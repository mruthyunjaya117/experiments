Looking for fast internet that isn’t throttled. Cc: @115900\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks #Verizon; it isn’t #FiOS, it’s the #FXNow app. There is no sound on the live TV after trying 30 minutes.😢 @4857 @928\\n@VerizonSupport Home.

Maybe it’s for me?\\n@VerizonSupport Apparently @VerizonSupport is experiencing \"longer than average wait times.\" Tell me about it. My office phone and internet has been out for more than two weeks. Same with my neighbors. Someone @115725 is lying to their boss, not just to me.\\n@VerizonSupport FiOS. And I love it. Not a single problem in 9 years.\\n@VerizonSupport Awesome. My @115725 office phones and internet have been out for more than two weeks, with nothing but broken promises and bullshit excuses.

And I\\'m seeing there are other reports coming in regarding loss of connection in the area.\\n@VerizonSupport TWC in New York had it. I don\\'t know where you get the feeds, but Verizon is big enough to make this better if it wanted to.\\n\\nThen again, despite several appointments my service is spotty enough I\\'m watching on a livestream.

I did get someone this morning who escalated to \"level 3\" and appears to know more...\\n@VerizonSupport I do. I just need a return label.\\n@VerizonSupport Not working for some reason. On the phone with a customer service rep. Thanks for trying anyway.\\n@VerizonSupport The day after it was on. Not buying it.\\n@VerizonSupport Today is 11/1/2017 ^CAR\\n@VerizonSupport And my 24th birthday is on 11/30/2017 ^CAR 😀 🎂\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/KMgkeRWB96\\n@VerizonSupport They said I was speaking with someone from the Multi Millions company or something like that?

This seems to be a recurring theme and no one has been out to check the equipment in over 4 years.\\n@VerizonSupport I will gladly when it occurs. This is always the issue; it is not consistent. I\\'ve asked that my equipment and fiber run be checked to no avail.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, and at the time it occurs, it appears to be hanging at Verizon servers. Usually however, when it occurs, it just hangs for a while and then suddenly starts working, almost as though the connection is being reset.\\n@VerizonSupport Speed tests always come back looking great. It is intermittent and it\\'s usually targeted: YouTube, Netflix, etc. Sometimes connection will be great, other times it will plummet and I can\\'t even access normal websites.\\n@VerizonSupport It’s a local channel\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks , I’m just wondering is Univision a must carry channel ?\\n@VerizonSupport Is Verizon even trying to settle with Univision? I though Univision is a must carry channel ?\\n@VerizonSupport That’s what I’m using. I’m on a desktop not a phone just to clarify. When I️ click login via tv provider and choose Verizon I️ don’t ever reach a website it’s a completely white screen\\n@VerizonSupport No the screen just goes white\\n@VerizonSupport Your website gateway is broken and I️ can’t get to a login screen\\n@VerizonSupport Then provide the NESNgo app like the other providers, or I will take my business to them https://t.co/I6xKipC0kT\\n@VerizonSupport This has been ongoing since April and it is unacceptable.\\n@VerizonSupport $4.99\\n@VerizonSupport Wonder woman. .it just said you have a free movie to rent the price had to be no more that $4.99?\\n@VerizonSupport rent\\n@VerizonSupport Super wack . I got charged for a free movie that was supposed to be a gift too\\n@VerizonSupport My Verizon\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m good.

Most of my channels are scrambling.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you for the update! I\\'m relieved to know it\\'s just a glitch. Was nervous there for a while.\\n@VerizonSupport @127621 my cat and I are in NY\\n@VerizonSupport Wifi and with a WiFi extender. WiFi signal has so far been 5x5. I dont think wifi is the problem.

Lie, Ignore, and he Wasted my time.\\n@VerizonSupport mobile account\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. To any service, actually. Just says “Searching”\\n@VerizonSupport Like WiFi? Yes, it does.\\n@VerizonSupport Chula Vista, CA and no from my knowledge nobody has Verizon.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular.\\n@VerizonSupport Oh, and phone connection refuses to work. However, T-mobile\\'s interface says only 40 up/down potential. Never had this problem with @116021\\n@VerizonSupport \"There appears to be something impacting the speed to your router. Click on the link below to troubleshoot.\" claims 147 up 151 down\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless. And changing channels did not help. Internal testing is biased. Thus independent connection used.\\n@VerizonSupport Cell 3x a day. Everyday\\n@VerizonSupport Residential. If its an outage in the hampton rds area, is it possible for you ti send out an alert?\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/oHET4nxSbP\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it is.\\n@VerizonSupport No video still.

Did a reset of the fios box.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s been too long. I\\'ve missed you.\\n@VerizonSupport I sent the DM to the Verizon and followed.\\n@VerizonSupport Is it to the official Verizon page? Because I did.\\n@VerizonSupport Wells Fargo. And I have used this multiple times and I’ve not experienced any issues until now. And I recently made a purchase a few minutes ago with the same card, and I had no issues. I am refraining from calling to make the payment, due to the $3 fee.\\n@VerizonSupport I fill out the info as normal. Type in the payment amount, then the payment method which is debit card. Fill out the info, then when it’s asking to submit, I hit submit and it gives me the “error, try again later or use another payment method.”\\n@VerizonSupport I do not use the app. I go to the actual website. https://t.co/wtMyZIx480\\n@VerizonSupport Home bill. I use Verizon bill pay.\\n@VerizonSupport Desktop, dsl from phone line, dry loop\\n@VerizonSupport I told you how this can be resolved as I told the rep I spoke with but yet you want to educate me.\\n@VerizonSupport No I\\'m good thanks too much time wasted with this already.  Time is money tick tock @VerizonSupport\\n@VerizonSupport Like I said can I get my last hour back. If you can\\'t give me that you can\\'t help.\\n@VerizonSupport No all I need is a replacement modem.  The 5ghz band is flakey at best.

And get a better automated system @VerizonSupport\\n@VerizonSupport I did no one is responding\\n@VerizonSupport Great in our DM. You just gave me the same number I have called since Sunday. An automated system with a 15 minute wait!  Huge help\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks. My problem actually was repaired through the troubleshooter on the website.\\n@VerizonSupport When I check the outage map is this a bad sign https://t.co/IQ8cbH6v8M\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon computers shut us down by mistake Sunday afternoon. Internet phone and tv.  Getting service back up has been a NOGHTMARE. As of today I have internet and still no tv.   Working with someone again this am who is telling me he hasn’t give my back my dvd services.\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry. Didn\\'t see this. The show itself. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport wireless\\n@VerizonSupport I’m not sure actually. I have an agent with me now, but we may have to start the hour over.\\n@VerizonSupport All TVs, and shows on TLC - 90 day fiancé is one\\n@VerizonSupport Honestly I\\'d rather just have a call than all this talk on twitter. But they show up as a choice. The sound doesn\\'t work correctly. I reported it twice. I just want it fixed, if you can\\'t fix it I would like money taken off my next bill. The service agent on the phone was awful.\\n@VerizonSupport Nothing, she said she couldn\\'t do anything. I asked to speak to a manager and she refused, then said someone would call me back within an hour. They called me back today when I was at work and couldn\\'t speak.\\n@VerizonSupport I did it all, myself and with your tech support.\\n@VerizonSupport I think I\\'m in. I should be signing in tonight.\\n@VerizonSupport I have time now and am at the cart.

Thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport They want me to do a secure chat on Facebook but I need a link.\\n@VerizonSupport And supposedly you’ve made your bills easier to read. I notice no change and when I click the link to see the changes, it’s a dead link\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport no i am considering adding it to my FIOS triple play\\n@VerizonSupport No. It’s the onhub connected to the fios fueled Ethernet cable.\\n@VerizonSupport Still terrible. I dare you to fix this\\n@VerizonSupport It righted itself after multiple attempts. This is a chronic problem, sometimes lasts all day.\\n@VerizonSupport 100% of the time we try to watch something on demand the video and audio breaks up. I’ve called about it at least 4 times. I’ve unplugged everything 726 times and followed your instructions. Problem not solved. Plus, your on demand selection is embarrassing.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t know. We only watch on demand on one. We’ve run into trouble with the same (roughly) dozen channels every time this happens. And I’m sent through the same trouble shooting process. Question is, why am I always having trouble\\n@VerizonSupport What’re those people called that go to customers houses to do these things? Techs? Are they not a thing anymore. Are customers now the techs?\\n@VerizonSupport currently but will reach out on DM at soonest opportunity.  Spoke with rep earlier and she was looking for update from engineer escalation team.  thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I can do that\\n@VerizonSupport I am referring to my WiFi at home\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 No need I will be transferring to a different provider when I’m off work. This is unacceptable\\n@VerizonSupport They never completed our auto pay or paperless when we transferred off family plan. We gave this over phone to Verizon rep. I was also awarded a $45 credit for the next three months due to data issues. And one line was supposed to be disconnected end of October that wasn’t.\\n@VerizonSupport Incompetent people. I am going to switch providers after work. Absolutely absurd and rude. I’m in actually dumbfounded at how they’re speaking to me right now. Unbelievable\\n@VerizonSupport Yes two boxes, it appears to be just this box/TV combo.\\n@VerizonSupport One TV and the main box. Happens to different channels.\\n@VerizonSupport yes!\\n@VerizonSupport Nope!\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s a new TV, so I\\'ve noticed it maybe 10-25% of the time it happens.\\n@VerizonSupport I got a human on the phone\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile service. Check my acct you will see the notes and the guarantee that I would be repaid for previous mistake by YOUR COMPANY! And now they blatantly disrespect me like this. I am disgusted\\n@VerizonSupport I had an agreement with you to fix a major issue and after a thousand attempts it was resolved. You forced me to pay the next 2 months only to be completely taken advantage of again! I have never felt so disrespected!!!!\\n@VerizonSupport slide in my dms https://t.co/fkCsk2lI7Y\\n@VerizonSupport The first date available :D just seeing if there\\'s a secret way to get an even earlier date\\n@VerizonSupport I have reset. Only the HD box is having the issue. Of course :-)\\n@VerizonSupport Power light on, nothing else\\n@VerizonSupport Neither.

Everyone is very great at saying that they\\'re \"sorry\", but it\\'s all meaningless.\\n@VerizonSupport No, they are instead making excuses as to why Verizon is allowed to no-show to tech visits and why promised manager call-backs don\\'t happen like they are supposed to.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ll let her know and pass the baton.  Hopefully someone can explain why her bill increased without her knowledge or consent.\\n@VerizonSupport I hope so!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it is, sometimes it will stay white but with no connection, tried to reset to factory default with no custom settings, the tests the tech did were inconclusive, said we will be receiving a call to upgrade the ONT\\n@VerizonSupport Just this app.\\n@VerizonSupport Today I go on to watch hbo on demand and the picture isn’t coming in and I get an error message\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t know what the difference is.

It\\'s fine!\\n@VerizonSupport Right, please go on... explain signal to noise ratio when every other channel works. I\\'ll wait...\\n@VerizonSupport So when I was watching espn for the last few weeks and it was fine, my splitter was good.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok, why is it selective to big events and perfect all day for sports center?\\n@VerizonSupport Right, the more important the game or pay per view, the hotter the copper gets. Now I get it. So you take no responsibility for this issue?\\n@VerizonSupport Nope\\n@VerizonSupport No, just when I\\'m charged $70 for tiling and games I want to watch- never on yes channel though\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure about ppv, but yes on espn\\n@VerizonSupport Your hotspot check your dms I\\'ve already heard from support  it\\'s just the run around since you started screwing customers who got unlimited\\n@VerizonSupport Home\\n@VerizonSupport No need for that.

The cable connections are fine\\n@VerizonSupport No internet access atm\\n@VerizonSupport we did that about a week ago and it still does it. should i get new cables?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes,I frequently restart both of my boxes and they’re fine for a few days,but then they start acting up again.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and it was freezing. 😔\\n@VerizonSupport I do not have a Verizon acct. A fraudulent Verizon Wireless acct was opened in my name &amp; just reported on my credit report.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the quick reply.  I\\'m not home right now, but will try this later this evening.  I have the Arris VMS1100 DVR model.\\n@VerizonSupport that’s not the question I asked.\\n@VerizonSupport If Access to https://t.co/FGziyL2j5C was included with a Center Ice subscription. This is included on the DirecTV Center Ice subscription.\\n@VerizonSupport I had to upgrade last night to get them - from basic to Premium - an add\\'l $40 per month.  Spike, ESPN, CNBC, etc.\\n@VerizonSupport May / June. I complained about this within a week and was told I needed to upgrade - so I didnt.  Bit the bullet yesterday.\\n@VerizonSupport 2) When i signed up - i asked that FIOS give me the same level of options at a cheaper monthly cost.\\n@VerizonSupport you really want to know?\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless.\\n@VerizonSupport Also hung up on me and were extremely rude\\n@VerizonSupport Someone called Verizon to change the name on my account and no one has any information to give me about this situation.\\n@VerizonSupport I already tried this earlier this week. Want to watch preseason basketball and can’t on league pass.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes dip shit\\n@VerizonSupport New York , queens\\n@VerizonSupport I just tried again on my laptop and Facebook works but anytime I open a link from FB it gives me the same error.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes if I turn off my WiFi and turn on my data, the articles open.\\n@VerizonSupport I would think it\\'s my home account because it seems to be a problem with the Wi-Fi.\\n@VerizonSupport Both.\\n@VerizonSupport I have one tv.\\n@VerizonSupport Everything each time. They\\'re all plugged into the same outlet.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. But overall the quality has degraded. Digital \"static\" and glitches when playing On Demand shows. Unacceptable based on how much I pay.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s happened with all different networks and premium channels\\n@VerizonSupport As I said earlier I have only one TV\\n@VerizonSupport You have to buy things on demand; I went to watch Hostel III and the English version cost money but the Spanish version was free\\n@VerizonSupport I only have internet so yes. Are there advanced notices provided anywhere?\\n@VerizonSupport Having advanced notices would be extremely helpful!\\n@VerizonSupport New Jersey\\n@VerizonSupport Wish I knew about that before I worked on my paper. At least now I have an excuse as to why I couldn\\'t finish it\\n@VerizonSupport I did, what doI do from here ?\\n@VerizonSupport The problem isnt the speed, its the consistency of it. theres always frequent lag and ping spikes and often says theres no int connection\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it is, and apparently it\\'s supposed to be the gigabit connection\\n@VerizonSupport Everytime I click sign in, I only get please wait and it keeps refreshing itself. I\\'ve signed in before on this phone and have had np\\n@VerizonSupport There is, but the other end went to an old desktop I haven\\'t used in years so I doubt it was doing anything\\n@VerizonSupport Done, then disconnected power for 10 seconds and plugged back in. After a min or 2 modem goes back to red light, still no internet.\\n@VerizonSupport I do\\n@VerizonSupport Ok, thank you very much for the assistance and information, I appreciate it!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I\\'ve tried rebooting a few times and it will blink white for a min or 2 then go back to red\\n@VerizonSupport both, so I assume it\\'s most of the channels I paid for.\\n@VerizonSupport one or two free\\n@VerizonSupport I didn\\'t give my credentials\\n@VerizonSupport you buy those channels for a price. Which I did. I gave you money to have all content. Well it\\'s not there\\n@VerizonSupport @158221 Please get Fibre Optic to all areas of PA as FAST as you can!\\n@VerizonSupport Not available in my area.\\n@VerizonSupport Router reset didn\\'t work, but the box reset did. Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport I know you say that each time Same topic since March NO resolution! Waiting for a call now already a little late!\\n@VerizonSupport The service rep behavior wasn\\'t acceptable. They can\\'t tell on us\\n@VerizonSupport cellular\\n@VerizonSupport They both suck\\n@VerizonSupport My damn 13 year old son could have answered my damn question!! Fios and your wireless people who work from you must not be educated\\n@VerizonSupport Fios\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you, would it be possible to send a text next time? :)\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure why it didnt. Not the first time. But I work alot and that show is my relax time\\n@VerizonSupport Absolutely,  thanks for checking in.. appreciate it\\n@VerizonSupport It is set as scheduled,  not sure what happened. I am going to see next week if happens again.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport yeah all connections are fine. All channels are coming in.\\n@VerizonSupport Once AGAIN, no fucking help from support. Don’t fuckin tell me to DM you and then spend several minutes asking for bullshit after I gave it\\n@VerizonSupport No because I’m still missing certain channels.\\n@VerizonSupport I’m done. It took less than 30 days for crap to start happening. I’m cancelling service.\\n@VerizonSupport What the hell is going on with your service? This crap keeps happening and it’s too expensive.\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/4ewbaXW6ce\\n@VerizonSupport Currently using Verizion Fios.\\n@VerizonSupport Pretty much always been. Got tired of suffering in silence. I unplug the damned thing weekly in hopes a reset will forestall the worst of it\\n@VerizonSupport Locks up constantly, in different ways. Takes too long to load DVR menu. DVR scheduling takes forever. Delays responding to remote commands.\\n@VerizonSupport Need to think about it and see if DTV will fix their problem.  But am considering\\n@VerizonSupport We just had Fios installed for wifi. Stayed with DTV for Sunday ticket.\\n@VerizonSupport Yea but I’m not spending all day messing with this crap to only have two or three working channels and have to mess with the coaxial.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport I’m done. Im canceling service and going back to @119000\\n@VerizonSupport That tweet was intended for @119000. I’m cancelling my FIOS services since I’m within my 30 days.\\n@VerizonSupport I am WAAYY pass that... and sick of being transferred... waiting on a supervisor to \"call back\"\\n@VerizonSupport I was told id get double play &amp; custom tv why do i have about 15 channels none of which i discussed and being told i have local package\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport 2/2 it\\'s weird too that it\\'s not just you guys -- it\\'s CitiCards and Capital One too, all at the same time.\\n@VerizonSupport I get a message saying that the channel is unavailable. That amongst many others, I only have TNT\\n@VerizonSupport I know of others in my area are having problems.  And I don\\'t have time to troubleshoot, unless I can charge you an hourly rate for my work.\\n@VerizonSupport DSL....Dang Slow Loading.  Y\\'all don\\'t have FiOS in our area...my closest neighbor is 1500ft away.\\n@VerizonSupport The price went up but the speed did not.\\n@VerizonSupport My guy Taylor got it straight! Thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport Really?  Every person I chatted with said they couldn\\'t call me. And then after wasting so much of my time the gave me a number to call.\\n@VerizonSupport I just wasted an hour of my vacation trying to get assistance from you. Why would I think that anything would get better now???\\n@VerizonSupport OK, I followed you, but don\\'t see the DM link\\n@VerizonSupport residential\\n@VerizonSupport Yes — but the question is, why doesn’t @115722 include all fees in advertised cost? Intentionally leaving them out isn’t misleading? 🤔\\n@VerizonSupport Knowing they will be included, why isn’t @115722 more transparent &amp; include “Verizon Surcharges &amp; Fees” in the advertised Bundle cost?\\n@VerizonSupport Again, not surprised — just disappointed in @115722 misleading w/ actual cost. Why not include ALL Verizon fees in cost advertised?\\n@VerizonSupport Like I said, I understand the fees. Disappointed w/ the misleading advertisements similar to the business practices of a used care salesman\\n@VerizonSupport Who should i speak to\\n@VerizonSupport 1/3 inquired about transferring buss serv to new address. never committed to serv but was sent equip. tried to return.\\n@VerizonSupport Not from the info I received from cust serv.  I\\'d say this is cramming!!\\n@VerizonSupport Currently heading to lunch and the gym, will be back at around 5:15. Thanks for the help so far.\\n@VerizonSupport not sure.... how can i check? thanks, again!\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the help. Hopefully I can find the right price.\\n@VerizonSupport $179, no contract, and top package with all premium channels.\\n@VerizonSupport Match the Spectrum price and we\\'d be back in a heartbeat!\\n@VerizonSupport No. It was for a service call one of st least 7 I\\'ve had since switching, not counting all the times I\\'ve had to call due to issues.\\n@VerizonSupport Can you DM. It\\'s another issue in need help with. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/9Z9JYUKwWw\\n@VerizonSupport I only have Internet.\\n@VerizonSupport yes the globe had a red light\\n@VerizonSupport no wifi. Have restarted etc and nothing.

Ok thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport @115725 I dont have time to waste on this.\\n@VerizonSupport You haven\\'t  resolved it with the 2 previous tests.  Ive lost enough time trying to get better service.  But @115725 is my only option.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes!\\n@VerizonSupport I think I\\'m on my way back!\\n@VerizonSupport I spoke with an associate by the name of Samora in either Charlotte, NC or California call center she works in Gift Crad hung up on me.\\n@VerizonSupport Do you mean router? If so, how do I do that?\\n@VerizonSupport No improvement whatsoever. #ReallyGettingAnnoyed https://t.co/Pk5iBHr6aC\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. On the ground behind the TV. Boyfriend has it screwed to the wall. https://t.co/dHG8Mj3Foe\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m fed up and tired. Will try all that tomorrow. Maybe by then it will have fixed itself. #wishfulthinking\\n@VerizonSupport Oh it\\'s definitely time to give up. Now the TV says I\\'m not subscribed to TBS. #EveryoneIsSubscribedToTBS https://t.co/09qcMeOBIo\\n@VerizonSupport Only one TV in the house, so no.\\n@VerizonSupport Screen stuck on \"preparing network connection\" - reconnected first one and was fine. JOKE!\\n@VerizonSupport No! Only one location for set top box. Why keep this service? NO HELP!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes that is correct, still does not work.  Cannot connect. #lost #dontgetverizoned\\n@VerizonSupport The connection works fine, first box connects and DVR is broke (told to me by Verizon), second can\\'t connect. BAD SERVICE!\\n@VerizonSupport It can\\'t connect to the network, @82272 tech support of no help and try to schedule maintenance call. Not happening- BAD SERVICE!\\n@VerizonSupport Its back now! Probably just a hiccup. Thank you for your speedy reply!\\n@VerizonSupport Change the on demand menu back to the way it was... 😂😂😂😂😂\\n@VerizonSupport Georgia\\n@VerizonSupport I guess I figured it would just “kick in” in next day or so? It didn’t really clarify.\\n@VerizonSupport Modem was definitely up as I could log into after it was power cycled. None of my devices (wired/wireless) would connect.\\n@VerizonSupport I didn\\'t really look, I just power cycled the router with no effect. After 20 min it was restored. Then it dropped again for 5min\\n@VerizonSupport Currently I am up with no red lights. This has happened in the past when Vz performs maintenance. FYI i WFH\\n@VerizonSupport Brooklyn, NY\\n@VerizonSupport Unfortunately, I didn\\'t check while my internet was down. Currently, everything is up and appears to be stable.\\n@VerizonSupport Stuck on swirling symbol https://t.co/Lx1MuPSQPF\\n@VerizonSupport Yea,  it works fine on app on phone. But pc. Forget it. So annoying\\n@VerizonSupport No, and this is a brand new computer. Not the pc. Windows 10 edge. An  Omen computer.\\n@VerizonSupport Unfortunately,the app is now giving me red circle swirling. Then plays then does the swirling again,hard to watch something that keeps that\\n@VerizonSupport it\\'s a red one on top white at bottom\\n@VerizonSupport Ok,  just checked and service back. Thanks for help anyway!\\n@VerizonSupport Vaguely. Will resetting that help if the problem is at your end?\\n@VerizonSupport account is locked\\n@VerizonSupport No no, everything is fine. Thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport See above thread, bot. Thx.\\n@VerizonSupport Will I be getting the $200? I also just got an email offering the $200 for trading in my s6\\n@VerizonSupport If I made the order on 9/12 and the rate expired 9/21, why would I not be getting the promotional rate?\\n@VerizonSupport The add-on charges are above and beyond the $99.99 bundle.  I asked for the $79.99 promotion and received the $99.99 rate.  Fix this?\\n@VerizonSupport Cart number below.  Why was I sent a mailer and charged a different price?  That\\'s bait-and-switch. https://t.co/wsXdec4n08\\n@VerizonSupport I found it, it lists the $99.99 price; when I called and asked specifically for the $79.99 price mentioned in the mailer.  Why the change?\\n@VerizonSupport You sent me a flyer with a price which prompted me to purchase your services.  When I purchased them, you charged me a different price. Why?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m a new customer, though?\\n@VerizonSupport The new customer deal is $20 less than  the new customer deal I’m using.\\n@VerizonSupport I’ll never understand charging reliable customers /more/ for “renewal discounts” than for new customer discounts.\\n@VerizonSupport This seems silly when I already contacted support. You’d rather lose a customer than lower my price because “it’s only for new customers.”\\n@VerizonSupport no it just says activities\\n@VerizonSupport im not posting her bill on twitter, that is just dumb. I can send it to you\\n@VerizonSupport no, phone started working without anyone having to come\\n@VerizonSupport It says the channel is not authorized.\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/HkAbVdulRZ\\n@VerizonSupport We only have cable on 1 TV so #yes it\\'s happening on all of our tvs 📺\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport It goes to the “sleep” screen. Nothing blocking the vent\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Still no good. Just had new wiring done to the house too. Was supposed to fix this. Nada.\\n@VerizonSupport This is by network also which is frustrating. Just saying. I would rely less on the search feature and try and figure out an on demand option for easier surfing.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s hard to navigate the on demand user interface. Specifically looking through the movies. It\\'s by genre, which is fine but A-Z? We gotta navigate with a remote lag too so it takes so much time to sift through\\n@VerizonSupport Ok so, it says \"Sign in with:\" and I choose \"Repair Ticket Number and ZIP Code.\" I \"sign in\" successfully.\\n\\nThen, it shows me the summary of the repair appt, and says \"Sign In\" again to make changes.\\n\\nI click that, and it takes me to a page that reloads endlessly.\\n\\nPlease help.\\n@VerizonSupport Good job. Your tech just arrived 2 hours late. He is as apathetic as your customer service.\\n@VerizonSupport May I get more informatiom about this speed?\\n@VerizonSupport And I had to take UNPAID time off of work. I should not have to pay $150 install fee for awful customer service. I am contacting the BBB!\\n@VerizonSupport Ok. Do that please\\n@VerizonSupport I stream from my DVR away from home all the time. Are you saying to attempt to resolve I need to be home?\\n@VerizonSupport I am home now. What do I need to do?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I do\\n@VerizonSupport I am out of home, connected to WiFi, app repeatedly says unable to connect to network. I can stream on all other apps. Not a WiFi issue.\\n@VerizonSupport Not achieving the speeds I was promised and your speed test tells me to contact you. I\\'ve tried chat but that failed too. Need my #bandwidth https://t.co/cUoxF8b63I\\n@VerizonSupport Wired from your FiOS equipment in my house. App states router test so assumption is it is from your router, not wifi. I pay for #gigabit.\\n@VerizonSupport Will do.\\n@VerizonSupport Wired. It\\'s giving me the same results (as I expected it would) from your router to your backbone. https://t.co/SNqLe3OX6r\\n@VerizonSupport residential, not wireless. thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport Please DM me. I need to give you my phone number so someone from the US could help me, or I need to explain what I need.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Safari worked. Any plans to make your homepage work on Chrome..?\\n@VerizonSupport to wait on a tech and pay a fee when all the wires and equipment for installation is here and I\\'m a certified pcst (4/8)\\n@VerizonSupport that doesn\\'t excuse nor explain why @115725 doesn\\'t have a legitimate veterans discount... all I\\'ve been referred to (1/2)\\n@VerizonSupport high end user... the only reason my service wasn\\'t instantly switched because I was sold gigabit internet now I have (3/8)\\n@VerizonSupport he called saying he would be here at 12.15pm. Over an hour later and nothing... https://t.co/eLEhKj86U9\\n@VerizonSupport @175907 Yo Verizon kudos to you guys for not airing the steelers game! Dey asss\\n@VerizonSupport We have DSL. But we are open to FIOS. We just don\\'t think we get it in our area.\\n@VerizonSupport It is. It has been going on since last night but suddenly started working again.

Only 1-2. There are a couple of older laptops, but rarely used.\\n@VerizonSupport Right now, only using one device.\\n@VerizonSupport What do you mean by disconnect &amp; how? There are devices that apparently are listed but aren’t even currently turned on. Pls move this to DM.\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t know what that means. Please DM.\\n@VerizonSupport Done\\n@VerizonSupport …and you’ve said it’s because we have ~6 devices using the network, but that doesn’t seem like it should be an issue either.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks.

All the deals involve adding like 100 channels.\\n@VerizonSupport yes, just clicked it.

Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular. I get the impression from the lady I talked to today, that it’s her cellular phone too.\\n@VerizonSupport My internet goes down at least once a day. There are many webpages I can\\'t visit; this occurs erratically. Your automated phone svc is NUTS.\\n@VerizonSupport It it only my access to webpages, on &amp; off, my getting on to internet at all sometimes, &amp; the frequent interruptions of a Netflix movie.\\n@VerizonSupport None at all. I don\\'t think it\\'s possible.

And it\\'s happening on multiple devices.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. That didn\\'t work. Still having the same issue.\\n@VerizonSupport I kicked up a fuss to get connected to supervisor and downgrade svcs. You must let cust know that channel change leads to new contract.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 You need to specify PST/EST on your call centers. Trying TOS and it says opens at 7am. EST/ PST? 611 working yet?\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 I\\'m through. Funny how one of the world\\'s biggest phone companies had phone issues...\\n@VerizonSupport I was dialing 611 and the customer service number listed on line\\n@VerizonSupport My mobile bill is wrong.

I looK forward to a hefty credit in my $300/mo bill\\n@VerizonSupport Wired.

(I checked a few times.) Reload issue isn’t just tonight. It’s constant. Tonight is just more annoying.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok. I did that. What is it supposed to do?\\n@VerizonSupport So is it supposed to stop constantly “loading” now?\\n@VerizonSupport And now it’s “loading” &amp; frozen. For $66/month I should be able to watch a continuous 10 minutes of TV, don’t you think?\\n@VerizonSupport If problem isn’t solved, what’s the next step? (Update: it just did the “loading” thing 3x! Though it didn’t freeze. It reloaded itself.)\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular. The old grandfather unlimited account.\\n@VerizonSupport ticket #2496\\n@VerizonSupport Just got it done, thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s so slow.  It\\'s horrible\\n@VerizonSupport Yes all.

Love you guys.\\n@VerizonSupport Residential\\n@VerizonSupport Keep offering options that don’t work for my unique situation and keep sidestepping actually helpin\\n@VerizonSupport Here’s the cord I’ll be cutting 🔌\\n@VerizonSupport By outsourcing and clearly lacking in training/supervisor resourcing, it proves it is your intention. You haven’t even offered to help lmao\\n@VerizonSupport Lmao you are still not offering to help. The right answer is: let me get your number and we will call you directly to work this out.\\n@VerizonSupport Stop assuming I’m stupid, you continue to act like I don’t know what I’m doing and making yourselves look stupid.\\n@VerizonSupport I’ll just continue to be an unhappy customer and tell everyone I know to cut cords.....since you still have only offered to “look into it” 😂\\n@VerizonSupport Hey @116136 good to know that other companies are now on your level of terrible customer service, at least the market is consistent now lol\\n@VerizonSupport yep, two rooms over from the router but with a clear line of sight.\\n@VerizonSupport my laptop doesn\\'t have an ethernet port\\n@VerizonSupport no, I have 1 computer.

Stay wired my friend.\\n@VerizonSupport No I am exposing you for you crap service you can DM me how to get out of it.\\n@VerizonSupport Just DM me the rules to cancel and you guys can sit on wired dells from 10 years ago\\n@VerizonSupport Not to mention I got 42 voice messages and never gave out my number and paid to have it not listed\\n@VerizonSupport And I had a single login to AppleTV instead of having to literally do over 40 verifications numbers and sites - you guys are the Stone Age.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'d a service visit to fix internet.

I’ve spent 5 hours on the phone and online trying to navigate a simple order change with no success. DM me to assist further.\\n@VerizonSupport I believe so the tax amount is higher than the rate!\\n@VerizonSupport Give us a better deal then. Hit me with an offer on Twitter right now.\\n@VerizonSupport Everything is good except video isn\\'t working on the local pole. Any idea how soon that will be resolved? Things had been going so good!\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s connected via a CableCard to a TiVo.\\n@VerizonSupport The tech attempted to, we ran through the guided setup, but then he said video isn\\'t working for the immediate area.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport fios\\n@VerizonSupport my online account is incorrect and I have been trying to get this fixed for 2 months\\n@VerizonSupport yes. i need my account scrubbed.\\n@VerizonSupport Only for residential I believe:(\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t need to toggle I need Fios for business at my address!\\n@VerizonSupport No @115722 for another year at my address:(\\n@VerizonSupport We\\'ve done everything!

It\\'s 6:40pm.\\n@VerizonSupport would happily report like, a bunch of website bugs for you guys though because I never don\\'t have problems\\n@VerizonSupport well he had me reset my router and now my chat with him is gone so...\\n@VerizonSupport it\\'s every time. this is a problem that should be fixed. I shouldn\\'t have to clear browser cache every time i want to use your site\\n@VerizonSupport the first is i have to reboot my router literally every day to connect to wifi every morning. i\\'m talking with my second person in 12 hrs\\n@VerizonSupport Sadly, I live in an area of NJ that does not offer @115722 . Might want to work on that. #Competition @116136 @15949\\n@VerizonSupport Everything is taken care of. I would still like a way to contact management... does that not exist within verizon?\\n@VerizonSupport After cycling, it\\'s connected but I\\'m bummed about the recent instability. Especially when two Amazon Echos tell me aloud about it 😒\\n@VerizonSupport Down again, blinking white globe.\\n@VerizonSupport Cycled router, it connected for a minute but is now blinking white &amp; connection is lost.\\n@VerizonSupport No changes. It\\'s been fine for almost a year but has randomly lost connection at least once a day for the last few days.\\n@VerizonSupport Just went down again, acting like it\\'s a reboot?

I live on a block of row homes though. I have 5 devices on the network, only 2 active right now. all are using 5G i think\\n@VerizonSupport you mean via ethernet?  that\\'s what the 3rd pic in the series above is.  I got 57 megabits per second down.  sorry if i\\'m misunderstanding\\n@VerizonSupport here are the results.  one WiFi from 20 ft away, one wired.  (the faster one is the wired test) https://t.co/64dueAX1Uz\\n@VerizonSupport the 50/50, internet only\\n@VerizonSupport It was over WiFi, but I don\\'t think it matters when it\\'s this slow. https://t.co/DR5dSvxh2R\\n@VerizonSupport The current update for Samsung s7/s7 edge.

You just wanna punt it to another team.\\n@VerizonSupport YOUR mobile app. Don\\'t try to blame somebody else, you guys own this piece of crap.\\n@VerizonSupport yep, as always.

I had service when I fell asleep last night and I woke up today with no service. Restarted phone numerous times.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport When I replaced the battery TV, Internet, Phone worked until the battery ran low. I just bought the battery today. I\\'m a network engineer and I\\'m very knowledgeable about technology. I need the BBU replaced. Status light is blinking green indicating a fault.\\n@VerizonSupport Power is fine 120v. I measured it with a volt meter. The lights on the ONT are blinking also. Its the BBU.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, TV, Phone, and Internet are all down.\\n@VerizonSupport System Status Blinking and Battery Red.\\n@VerizonSupport You are throttling my speeds from 150/150 to 40/40. Should probably not do that since it\\'s illegal 😘\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. 40/40. Hence how I got the speeds.\\n@VerizonSupport Already did. Same result\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Now stop throttling.\\n@VerizonSupport Hard wired.\\n@VerizonSupport WOW! Now my speeds are even slower at 24/40. Thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport How do I go about canceling service with @115725? Tired of doing this every month. @115900 is offering gig speeds for $10 more.\\n@VerizonSupport What were you issuing in May 2013?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, so I’m asking, should I️ have to switch providers to obtain up-to-date equipment?\\n@VerizonSupport Apologies, but you still haven\\'t answered as to when a customer can expect new equipment--5 years? When? #FIOS\\n@VerizonSupport So, if I\\'m a customer for 10 years, you\\'re not going to upgrade my equipment, ever? What qualifies as signing up for \"new service?\" #FIOS\\n@VerizonSupport Does that mean ALL equipment, or cable boxes? Not replacing tech for customers who opt to stay with you seems wrong #FIOS\\n@VerizonSupport What is the router you currently provide to new customers? Does it support 802.11ac?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, although we pay for faster (intermediate) wifi, the system can\\'t support smart TV playback (amazon prime netflix, etc.)\\n@VerizonSupport We’ve been told they dug up something downtown. That and our little copper wire that needs an upgrade to fiber before we decamp to Cox.\\n@VerizonSupport need a box because it wont fit in my tv setup at the moment.\\n@VerizonSupport I guess it’s still not working. I was told to wait from the cable team to contact me\\n@VerizonSupport I’m trying to figure out how my bill is 125.11 if I haven’t had service since September 3. Each call center rep gives me a different amount.\\n@VerizonSupport 2. I have unlimited data and my hotspot has worked perfect until the recent \"upgrade\" which now limits my access after 15gb.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks.

Top light is red\\n@VerizonSupport Didn’t work as usual.\\n@VerizonSupport I can now.\\n@VerizonSupport Back up!\\n@VerizonSupport No it just says it should be restored by 3:04pm.  But that\\'s what it said last time and it was never restored\\n@VerizonSupport Still nothing\\n@VerizonSupport Every other channel is working fine\\n@VerizonSupport Still doesnt work\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport No. Just frozen or black screen\\n@VerizonSupport It was not working last night. Last time I watched it was Wednesday night. Also trouble with 551, 552 and starz channels\\n@VerizonSupport Tried it but no change\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. https://t.co/o20qqy837s\\n@VerizonSupport It seems to have gotten better now. We couldn’t figure it out. Tried restarting the router several times but the quality was terrible.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, not having the same issues\\n@VerizonSupport You can help by telling me \\n-why I was on hold for 40mins with no answer. \\n-why I was hung up on\\n-why my 9:30pm EST callback is 7 mins late.\\n@VerizonSupport If you’re the social media team, how are you capable of porting phone numbers? Please enlighten me. I’d love to hear this\\n@VerizonSupport this is part of a computer scam that she was a victim of. These people are calling relentlessly all day@and night.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport No they haven’t but we plan on calling them\\n@VerizonSupport yes it was\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless connection https://t.co/ktpgCfflu8\\n@VerizonSupport No I do not. My cable just shows a black screen\\n@VerizonSupport My cable isn\\'t working either. Is there an outage in Delaware?\\n@VerizonSupport Fios is dead. Can’t ping public default gateway.\\n@VerizonSupport They surely do not\\n@VerizonSupport @1561 charging $2 an episode to watch shows on demand now even if I’m subscribed to them is what you’re saying?\\n@VerizonSupport Haven\\'t checked the ONT, but if the 800# has a recording about an outage I don\\'t think it\\'s me. ;) Just curious if its a planned maintenance\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s so weird.. 888-553-1555 says there is an outage. Usually your social media team has more details..\\n@VerizonSupport I assume it\\'s this small black box in my garage\\n@VerizonSupport I only see one light which is next to \"power Ok\" and is green\\n@VerizonSupport No. It\\'s dark\\n@VerizonSupport @214965 So there is an outing in Delaware?\\n@VerizonSupport I can\\'t, I\\'m locked out of my account and the only option I got was US mail for a new password which is insane. Will wait til morning\\n@VerizonSupport It seems to be good again, I\\'ll let you know if it cuts out again\\n@VerizonSupport Was going to check, but internet now randomly came back on.  Thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport It seems to just say video on demand outage.  Does that mean I should have other interruptions?  Reset Ont and still nothing.\\n@VerizonSupport No problem with TVs... just usual On Demand is down. Not interested in Tweeting text support at 1am. Just fix your recurring system crashes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, your service simply fails every few days... not worth 2 hr tech call to reboot my STB/Rtr 9 times to find out its a fios system failure\\n@VerizonSupport Diagnostics say ethernet is down.  Other users in my surrounding towns are tweeting the same issue.\\n@VerizonSupport Just the internet...both my rokus are connecting the network and the local network but not the internet\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/3MiJMbwP6k\\n@VerizonSupport Now the internet light on my router is orange\\n@VerizonSupport The 4 lights on the main turned off and then turned back on\\n@VerizonSupport @215878 Wish you\\'d come to our condo\\n@VerizonSupport Nope the screen didn’t move.\\n@VerizonSupport VOD. And yes we have.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, also in Edge (3rd browser), but it seems to work if I specifically only open it in my mobile browser. Is the limitation intentional?\\n@VerizonSupport Trying again today. Can you please help with my original query, or give me a working live-chat link, or tell me how to fix it?\\n@VerizonSupport Indeed. Told it is a MDU outage - be nice if fixed in time for the @188390 game this evening...\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and all have come and gone.\\n@VerizonSupport I was logging into my Verizon residential fios account\\n@VerizonSupport Yes but not on a desktop only mobile.\\n@VerizonSupport I have tried it from 3 different browsers and have cleared everything on each and it still pops up.\\n@VerizonSupport The issue has been replicated on all mobile devices I have tried but not on a desktop or laptop\\n@VerizonSupport I have and it might have something to do with my slow internet as it does change to a checkmark if I wait about 30 seconds.\\n@VerizonSupport No it\\'s the best we can get for where we live. 3mbs but I am moving to get 1gps from you guys\\n@VerizonSupport Will get a different service instead, thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport It was residential and I spoke with several representatives, no help at all.\\n@VerizonSupport @217699 The order number was revised 3 times yet kept getting error. CS rep created new order but install is on Monday - 3 wks after initial order\\n@VerizonSupport i have tried to do a chat and find out what is going on with my bill and no one is available.\\n@VerizonSupport Installation\\n@VerizonSupport @217890 step it up VERIZON. my girl has got places to go to make money so she can feed her damn son\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you for getting back to me.  Still the best customer service in the twitterverse!\\n@VerizonSupport No. Our wireless service. No service in Healdsburg.\\n@VerizonSupport Also spent more than 12+ hours on phone with customer service reps with little to no help with all my issues. I think change would be best\\n@VerizonSupport Hsl. Been promised fios for 2 months by customer service\\n@VerizonSupport multiple people in my area have been having issues with their phone connecting to LTE it just stays in 3G\\n@VerizonSupport the chat link does not seem to work can you provide a new one please\\n@VerizonSupport dm me ill send my number and if you could call that would be the best way\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m having my Fios installed this weekend &amp; was being sent a hotspot in the meantime. Wanted to check on delivery status.\\n@VerizonSupport Most texts and calls are going to my old iPhone even though I turned off cell data, WiFi, blue tooth etc.\\n@VerizonSupport I entered my name and phone number then got 3 announcements of large wait times and left. Kindly have someone respond to my email of 28SEP\\n@VerizonSupport The fact that I cant even make a phone call because i have 1-2 bars is outrageous\\n@VerizonSupport ...10 all-time dumbest customer service moves I\\'ve ever seen. Mind-boggling!\\n@VerizonSupport great example here of how to do it wrong. I\\'ve spent hours talking with a dozen Verizon reps, yet there aren\\'t any notes - so each time I\\n@VerizonSupport ...was my fave though, when you told me I didn\\'t have Verizon, and to look on my bill to see what phone company I have. That makes the top\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon Mobile\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Went through online support. Earliest available was Friday morning. Had the same problem last week.\\n@VerizonSupport My residential line is AT&amp;T, our only option here. Just like Verizon is only option for cell service here.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I did :) Have my PC wired directly to the router with a 50ft Cat5e cable\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t think that\\'s possible atm unfortunately\\n@VerizonSupport For tech support again for another 30 minutes he was dropped from the line as wa the tech support agent who had JUST connected.\\n@VerizonSupport Slow service while watching @116602\\n@VerizonSupport Oh that’s cool you don’t respond to my answer. Might as well been put on hold...\\n@VerizonSupport Yes the 13th. Understand you’re busy, but if a cancellation comes up...\\n@VerizonSupport So I’m guessing that was a no? Who can I contact for a refund?\\n@VerizonSupport I hope so or I’m going to be even more upset than I already am.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I was, PADQ0AY5Y1. Believe it’s still open\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport That would be for you people to figure out and, it wasn’t all the channels!\\n@VerizonSupport It isn’t wiring. I work in the audio/video industry &amp; nothing has changed inside. It started acting up the other day. So, ur mess on ur end\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, from you all\\n@VerizonSupport So, do it\\n@VerizonSupport So, fix whatever you people need to fix on your end! This was the 3rd night in a row having some of the channels breaking up\\n@VerizonSupport Contact the person who is using my email and tell them to use their own. It’s really not that difficult on your end. Your mistake NOW FIX IT.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m taking Verizon to court!!!\\n@VerizonSupport HEY!!! I\\'M STILL WAITING FOR SOMEBODY ON THE LINE!!!\\n@VerizonSupport Just WIFI. Tech moved our router but did not fix the issue. Said our router wasn’t strong enough to cover entire house. We have zones with zero signal.\\n@VerizonSupport Built in 2003. Have never used an extender\\n@VerizonSupport Lol, already been assisted by Straight Talk Wireless, 10 gigabytes for $45 a month. Of high-speed data. If you can assist that\\n@VerizonSupport Your support sucks! It really really does.\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/VxTpmPW2c0\\n@VerizonSupport And I’m nowhere near Philadelphia or Boston https://t.co/kUo25bgAcp\\n@VerizonSupport It’s not. I’m not in either TV market\\n@VerizonSupport Credit where credit is due- @115725 reached out and resolved the issue.\\n@VerizonSupport Just followed but unable to DM - of course this didn\\'t work\\n@VerizonSupport On my iPhone and my Mac.  Tried with FiOS and my cell network.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I am able to log in to https://t.co/7LXgZvF2xQ\\n@VerizonSupport I wiped out my cookies and things are working.  It\\'s very odd.  But I am working correctly now.  I appreciate your trying to help and apologize for wasting your time!\\n@VerizonSupport The Comedy Central app seems to be affected as well.\\n@VerizonSupport I noticed it about 25 minutes ago.\\n@VerizonSupport It happens within the IOS USA application and in safari on my iPhone.  If also happens on Firefox and Safari on my Mac.  I am going to https://t.co/IquwA5nRvB to start the process.\\n@VerizonSupport I paid extra to go from 50mbs to 100 with no noticeable difference and then u offer 1 Tera bite for the same price I pay for 100 but I can’t get that price because I’ve only been with u for as long as u’ve been available. I pay over 300 a month and I don’t think it’s worth it\\n@VerizonSupport Tried that multiple times, had 2 different Verizon technicians at my house, trying 3 routers, exchanging equipment in the basement, swapping cables, etc. I’m tired of trying!\\n@VerizonSupport But why is a Sixers-Celtics game blacked out while I\\'m nowhere near either area?\\n@VerizonSupport I did search and NBATV was the only network carrying the game. Is there a way to test if 07081 is in that blackout area? BTW thanks for the quick responses.  Greatly appreciate the customer service!\\n@VerizonSupport I already have every channel u offer and 100 MB’s that I pay 80 bucks for. Trying to get rid of u\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it happens to all channels on my primary box only. After rebooting box it fixes until I️ change the channel\\n@VerizonSupport No answer there either. Is anyone working tonight?\\n@VerizonSupport OK, I\\'ve been helped online. Thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes the question was answered and a manager with slightly better manners assisted us.\\n@VerizonSupport This is my phone while I stand in my kitchen 1 bar of WiFi https://t.co/pvrYWrksn1\\n@VerizonSupport It does not\\n@VerizonSupport The 5G is pathetic we are very disappointed customers\\n@VerizonSupport Only the iPhones seem to locate the 5 TiVo and Printer and Kindle don\\'t see it\\n@VerizonSupport Yep! Just did it now.\\n@VerizonSupport I’m using Chrome. Should I try Firefox?\\n@VerizonSupport Firfefox and safari also aren’t working. https://t.co/NHYzdVrLCG site is where it gets stuck. Turned off all of my browser extensions and tried multiple laptops.\\n@VerizonSupport It’s just USA Network so maybe it’s their redirect?\\n@VerizonSupport Actually no, isn’t working with ABC Freeform either\\n@VerizonSupport I haven’t but I can log into my account successfully\\n@VerizonSupport I am!\\n@VerizonSupport Yea, I’ll just make sure I’m signed out fully on those!\\n@VerizonSupport Technically I got a 10x speed increase. I have a 75 “M”bps connection https://t.co/uq4Zn3ihQ1\\n@VerizonSupport Much better with wired. What are my options ? https://t.co/Z97MQX71oK\\n@VerizonSupport Did the factory reset the other day and the speed was ok the other day. Today it’s down to ~1mbps again https://t.co/DFe8yKeE2N\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless.\\n@VerizonSupport Wired speed is good. Around 60 mbps. Wireless is very bad.\\n@VerizonSupport No. No wireless device.\\n@VerizonSupport It’s on auto. What is the recommended value?\\n@VerizonSupport no, only an Xbox\\n@VerizonSupport Wired.\\n@VerizonSupport I subscribed to 150mb , I get 1.5 .\\n@VerizonSupport DSL Service, was expecting to get Fios.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it is , actually can you tell me how much the 100 Mbps internet would cost monthly with taxes and fees?\\n@VerizonSupport That’s the issue. I am in new construction. But my close neighbors all have Fios availability and don’t currently use fios. Have been told that they just need to add me to system, but I keep getting transferred back and forth. Please have tech support DM me!\\n@VerizonSupport My entire family. I\\'m not receiving all of my texts or phone calls. Wireless mobile service. Been going on for a couple of weeks now.\\n@VerizonSupport We have six (!). We can see the info on channels but no pic or sound. I\\'ve re booted box and checked cable many times. I think we need an expert to fix. ??\\n@VerizonSupport Set top box needed to be reset this morning via phone call otherwise it would not work and the Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be working after having already been reset as well.\\n@VerizonSupport One moment as I am currently resetting the router a second time.\\n@VerizonSupport These are the lights that I have on my router at the moment which are both on (not flashing). https://t.co/I3Xps8v97G\\n@VerizonSupport Not exactly sure how to mess with this, however, everything seemed to be working fine without the Ethernet before. https://t.co/BVsNm6HRuZ\\n@VerizonSupport Neither my phone nor my console will connect to the internet.\\n@VerizonSupport You mean via Ethernet?\\n@VerizonSupport On the Univision Now app.\\n@VerizonSupport I was able to log in on the FOX Sports Go app. Univision is not asking for my credentials. It\\'s trying to sign me in with saved credentials.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I\\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled and the same issue persists.\\n@VerizonSupport Both white but my Xbox can’t connect\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t have a long enough Ethernet cable and I can’t reset the big box because it’s in another room and the people in there are already asleep\\n@VerizonSupport My phone can connect but not the Xbox. And when it was connected it’s like if the WiFi kept crashing. And now it won’t even connect\\n@VerizonSupport I tried before contacting you guys and just a lil ago\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah which I don’t understand why\\n@VerizonSupport Is there anyway you can check that\\n@VerizonSupport That’s fine\\n@VerizonSupport never got a bill every time i look at the apps it’s say not available except today that says your oder have been canceled\\n@VerizonSupport No one showed up today to install my cable. I’ve waited all day\\n@VerizonSupport I refuse to keep paying you all almost $200 a month and this crap keeps happening for no reason.\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s despite me turning text alerts off in the past, by the way. How many times do I have to turn it off? Now I have to get up in a few hours, and I\\'m wide awake and pissed. 😡\\n@VerizonSupport long story short you guys are actually not allowed to provide fios service in my area, some archaic law or sumtin, terrible\\n@VerizonSupport This is not entirely true. It has to be the router you or your vendor sales. You are even required to input it serial numbers on your ordering website \"or the technician won\\'t install service\". Your service cancellation process cannot be done online, and calling get you nowhere.\\n@VerizonSupport The downstairs tv is fine\\n@VerizonSupport Okie dokie\\n@VerizonSupport I know that number by heart now. As I said, 4-5 hour long convos w/ them. They claim the issue is fixed. It is not fixed. I can\\'t follow up w/ them after the convo. The same process repeats. How can I get a billing mgr on that line who I can follow up w/ or a VZ office to visit?\\n@VerizonSupport Only if someone can communicate the truth to me.  Otherwise I’m #done\\n@VerizonSupport My mobile account.  If you’ve got a direct number of someone I can speak with maybe we can resolve some issues.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 thank you\\n@VerizonSupport It would be an upgrade &amp; mobile\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular 👋🏼\\n@VerizonSupport Everything has been moving extremely slow and the 1x keeps appearing and when it doesn’t it just circles. Websites don’t load and some txts don’t go thru 😢\\n@VerizonSupport Network issues and they need 24-48 hours to address it. Being without the internet is absurd. They are like robots reading a script\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.That\\'s where the window of 24-48 hours came in to play. Gravely concerned after the 48 hrs I\\'ll hear some other excuse.\\n@VerizonSupport DSL on router blinking red light...not able to get on internet. Promised yesterday today would be fixed...now they say an additional 48 hrs.\\n@VerizonSupport No sorry for the way a rep of your company spoke to me? More reason to drop your service.\\n@VerizonSupport In Staten Island NY 10312\\n@VerizonSupport Whoops - realized I had accidentally signed into my father\\'s account 😅 but I\\'m unable to sign into my personal account because the mobile link isn\\'t working?\\n@VerizonSupport I do not have a User ID connected to my account - I\\'ve always done \"one-time payments\" because of this. When I sign in, it brings me to my family\\'s account - not mine. The one-time payment link is not working and brings me to the same page.\\n@VerizonSupport Ah ok, so is it possible a national broadcast picked that game up, and wasn\\'t listen in my tv guide?\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Sorry about that. Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks, turns out my device was being stubborn - all is well.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport I already called customer service. I already paid the charges. Thanks anyway though.\\n@VerizonSupport It was for enterprise. After 20 minutes of being on hold a very nice representative answered my questions. However, if this is any indication of customer support, I would not like to endure this again.\\n@VerizonSupport This was for a second cell line I thought I was adding as a shared plan but was a separate plan just all on my account. They told me I couldn\\'t cancel it immediately when I realized what had happened &amp; had to wait 24 hrs but they shipped the phone!\\n@VerizonSupport ?\\n@VerizonSupport Ok thank you\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile\\n@VerizonSupport I do.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I can.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I did it. Still noting changed. Red circle on router\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, i know.\\n@VerizonSupport I did check, its says everything its fine, but my internet does not work. Have red light on my router. Did rebot router few times and still not working.\\n@VerizonSupport Never mind! I am off hold now. Thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport Everything from March 7 to yesterday wasn\\'t saved to my cloud even though I backed it up twice and now it\\'s gone because I had to reset my phone\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks! I have a billing question.\\n@VerizonSupport It was my mobile account where I was upgrading my phone in your cyber monday sale. I already called and had the situation resolved but still had to jump through too many hoops, all because I\\'m poor and had to borrow money save money\\n@VerizonSupport It’s a cellular account\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon support, I have a problem I need help with.\\n@VerizonSupport Squirrels birds and wind routinely damage the lines and box on the power pole, knocking out tv phone&amp;internet service for the neighborhood. Has been happening regularly since August. Frustrating when I gotta meet deadlines\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport My bad: Meant to include this pic. https://t.co/qMuaWE28WX\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, spent a while on chat today with Verizon.....\\n@VerizonSupport We already pay too much for the service. True unlimited is no longer offered, and I probably can’t even stream before we get throttled, anyway. So, I’ll just continue to hope on #Xfinity showing up in the area. Greenwood, CA(if you really feel like doing something).\\n@VerizonSupport Appreciate your advice\\n@VerizonSupport I’ll need to call you guys....\\n@VerizonSupport They fixed me up!!!\\nThank you much!!!\\n@VerizonSupport No Fios TV.  Did not check phone... land line though.\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.  Press the blue button.  Already spoken to tech support many times.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.  Temporarily. Until the next day.\\n@VerizonSupport I am an existing customer who would like to change my package to the gigabit internet package offered in my area.\\n@VerizonSupport We use @116136 at the company (FIOS is not available here) and myself and most of our employees use @115722 at home. Our systems work great from home (everything we run is in the cloud) but we are pulling our hair out re comcast at the office...\\n@VerizonSupport Yes - we have the same issue going through our switch as well as connecting directly to the comcast modem.\\n@VerizonSupport We keep getting kicked out of our MS SQL database which is in the cloud (employees at home using FIOS NEVER have this problem), the internet just drops intermittently, etc. We\\'ve replaced everything on our end to fix. Wish we could get FIOS here - but its not here yet...\\n@VerizonSupport And than when I go thru all the steps after I troubleshoot it still doesn\\'t play https://t.co/u6elkJvkdC\\n@VerizonSupport You aren’t about helping existing customers. We are just cash cows. Prices go up, service goes down until we have no other choice but to switch providers.\\n@VerizonSupport I am back up now. After getting through you awful automated system that talked me in circles and told me to call back then tried to force me into the same automated troubleshooting steps as if it’s stuck on an infinite loop I was able to get through to someone\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport ok: https://t.co/zBaRbZdD57\\n@VerizonSupport where would i find that information\\n@VerizonSupport I can’t access internet on phone\\n@VerizonSupport How do I do that?\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen that. Would it be something I have if I had the mandated Fios service through my apartment\\n@VerizonSupport Ok before I head down there, is there anything else I can try to fix the problem\\n@VerizonSupport I think I found it. About to try this.\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure if I did this right but it\\'s still not working, internet light still isn\\'t lit up. Should I have heard a sound on the box\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s not the \"battery emergency use\" is it? I held down alarm silence for a minute and didn\\'t hear a beep\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ll try again and hold down until I hear beep\\n@VerizonSupport Uh, what would that look like ?\\n@VerizonSupport Nope\\n@VerizonSupport No it\\'s green https://t.co/dNwK2Sp8nB\\n@VerizonSupport Sent a message. Hopefully you are more helpful than your supervisor who is being extremely rude.\\n@VerizonSupport My husband is on the phone with the 3rd cs rep with no success. We are being told again they can\\'t honor the package your original cs rep signed us up for. we\\'ve had service for a week. This is terrible and cs reps are rude and unhelpful. What information can I provide?\\n@VerizonSupport My husband does. Md11328083649. We requested the recording of the sign up conversation where a premium channel was promised for 2 years for free. If we can\\'t have what was offered we will cancel our service. It\\'s bad when you\\'d rather go back to comcast.\\n@VerizonSupport They couldn\\'t guarantee it was recorded. Please help us resolve now. They said it will take a week to know if it was recorded.\\n@VerizonSupport And if it\\'s not? I\\'m guessing it will be conveniently not recorded. Why can\\'t this promotion be added to our service as advertised and promised?\\n@VerizonSupport As previously stated, this is the promotion that was verbally promised and agreed to. Not or fault if it was entered incorrectly https://t.co/oXBu3yswEH\\n@VerizonSupport What is the plan of action if the call was not recorded, as I expect to hear (if I get a call back)?\\n@VerizonSupport Ok. We\\'ll wait to see. If what we were promised isn\\'t honored we\\'ll just cancel or pressure legal action. A terrible way to treat brand new customers. I will make sure to tell everyone to avoid Fios at all costs.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes already sent the number in a previous message\\n@VerizonSupport I can email if you provide a contact.\\n@VerizonSupport no\\n@VerizonSupport also no\\n@VerizonSupport yep\\n@VerizonSupport alright, I’ll get back to you after I reset everything\\n@VerizonSupport It didn’t work.\\n@VerizonSupport yes https://t.co/RExb7Gilih\\n@VerizonSupport I just tried swapping out splitters and it improved but is still an issue... any other thoughts? Sorry was on vacation\\n@VerizonSupport I️ would assume it is somewhere in the basement where the main unit is at. This could impact all TVs though?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport For some random reason there are certain channels that do no come in clearly\\n@VerizonSupport Nope, and we have two routers(second serving as an extender). One on the 1st and one on the second. My room is on the third, but the WiFi problems are throughout our townhouse.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I do\\n@VerizonSupport Not that I know of\\n@VerizonSupport Not even letting me run the test on my laptop using the 2.5ghz internet\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport No.. just WiFi\\n@VerizonSupport This happened. https://t.co/E8tJoKqn3o\\n@VerizonSupport 5G\\n@VerizonSupport How? This is another result.. https://t.co/R9SxWBG5it\\n@VerizonSupport I am literally 4 feet away from the router. Literally.\\n@VerizonSupport 13 lol\\n@VerizonSupport The devices I use are wireless, so I’m constantly on WiFi. Should I switch internet service providers since I’m not getting the wireless speeds I’m contractually paying for? I need #wireless service!!\\n@VerizonSupport Better but still not what I’m paying for lol https://t.co/gveKIAGH2i\\n@VerizonSupport Even worse download speeds! https://t.co/RhihbZFKVu\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m more concerned with the TVs in my other rooms. The phone is just what I used to show the media server showing up like any other streaming media device on my network\\n@VerizonSupport The cable box is set up and working fine. It shows up on my home network (visible from my phone, pc, smart TV) as a media server. Trying to stream from a smart TV was successful on a local channel, but not a cable channel. Am I doing something wrong?\\n@VerizonSupport ✔\\n@VerizonSupport Where do I start? Over 8 hours on the phone the past 2 weeks, or the bill for the router that we didn’t buy and the fact that we had to go out of our way to return it? And then they cancel our account so we have to set up a new one. And now we have no internet.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes! You guys disconnected my account!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport still no reply? Wow.\\n@VerizonSupport mobile.... all ya need to do is look back in our DMs... ya know, the DMs the person who was \"looking into\" it never replied back to!\\n@VerizonSupport Lagging in call of duty\\n@VerizonSupport 92.22 Mbps for the download and I can’t get anything on the upload because the test won’t finish that part\\n@VerizonSupport Tried wired and wireless the upload test failed for both\\n@VerizonSupport The wired test was with a PC and yes I’ll unplug it\\n@VerizonSupport More than once and they couldn’t help - said I️ needed to wait - then I️ called and you hung up twice\\n@VerizonSupport How do I cancel TV and just get internet? I don\\'t want router either, have my own. Just want the network connection. I can\\'t manage to do it on the site.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Sorry I didn\\'t pick the right account\\n@VerizonSupport Got this the first two times https://t.co/ojjfOQirkr\\n@VerizonSupport Hey, aren\\'t ya gonna help me?\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile. I tried to call right back but now they’re “closed”\\n@VerizonSupport Yes haven\\'t been under contract for a month can I cancel\\n@VerizonSupport Displeased with the effectiveness and efficiency of your cable just cable internet is fine it\\'s better than @116136 net but your cable is unbearable intolerable inept. You two could really learn something from one another.\\n@VerizonSupport Don\\'t think you can resolve a poorly structured user interface, extremely laggy slow cable unfortunately. Would be nice though\\n@VerizonSupport So can I discontinue my service in the 1st month of my contract without penalty?\\n@VerizonSupport @241300 Take ya ass back to comcast\\n@VerizonSupport The guy i spoke to was, intentionally or not, deceptive. He made it sound like I was going to lose 2 channels. Just 2 channels! Somewhere there is a chat transcript showing this move. It was a dirty move. I would never have agreed to the package I was given. I feel cheated.\\n@VerizonSupport Okay, that\\'s the key. I am confident that if the chat is examined my point will be clear.\\n@VerizonSupport And how do I contact? This way?\\n@VerizonSupport Hi returning to speak to a billing specialist, hoping we can resolve this.\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/jfTG7kgT6e\\n@VerizonSupport okay, I did . The link opened. No one is communicating with me.\\n@VerizonSupport 3. for Internet. Can I do that and *NOT* be fined a 350.00 fee?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve talked to several support members this evening and no one has been able to help. Maybe you can?\\n@VerizonSupport I have, and it appears, as far as I can tell, that there is no package that costs $110.00. That is literally the line I cannot (or will not) cross given my other expenses.\\n@VerizonSupport My contract was about to expire, and I agreed to switch to a different package, but it turns out the channel packer I now have is really lousy. The previous one I had is no longer offered, and I get that. But i do not want the package I now have. The person I spoke to via chat 1\\n@VerizonSupport No phone service\\n@VerizonSupport Cell phone. I don\\'t have a land line.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Why what\\'s wrong?\\n@VerizonSupport WIRELESS\\n@VerizonSupport No I haven’t because I shouldn’t have a 99+% speed drop from just being wireless and I can’t do a wired Speedtest\\n@VerizonSupport As I’ve said at this current time the speeds are within the margins as Verizon techs have mention of at least 75% of the purchased speed of 50mb/50mb\\n@VerizonSupport And I do that all the time when see the problem occur.\\n@VerizonSupport Doesn’t resolve permanently.About this I was on the phone w/Verizon tech had D/L 20mb+, but U/L 78mb+/-. After they reset connection the U/L &amp; D/L went to 50mb+ and this was over WiFi. Not equipment on my side, it’s on Verizon side that this eventually happens. Not happy\\n@VerizonSupport It seems that the fix requires having Verizon Tech Support reprovision my Verizon router and reset the ONT.\\n@VerizonSupport After so many routers and already an ONT replacement it’s occurred with all those pieces of equipment intermittently every so often. The common denominator is on you end.\\n@VerizonSupport Back to normal for now. This will eventually happen again, but it shouldn’t.\\n@VerizonSupport Both. On multiple devices. iPhone X, latest iMac and MacBook Pro. Definitely not a hardware issue.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport I spoke with two different representatives.  One didn’t know anything and the other was condescending and knew just as little.  Both said you can’t change the hdmi settings on the stb, told me it was a tv issue, transferred me to the wrong department when I asked for a supervisor\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport @246573 Happening in queens as well. Rebooted all the boxes no fix. U have an outage\\n@VerizonSupport All tv’s all channels\\n@VerizonSupport @246575 Same issue.  ESPN not working.  Westchester county, NY\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. It seems others have replied in the same area that seems to be an issue in the NYC area.\\n@VerizonSupport Residential. Some channels are back now but many still pixelated with sound in and out\\n@VerizonSupport East*\\n@VerizonSupport @246575 There is video and audio stuttering on many channels and in some cases there is no HD channel.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it is! As for the PlayStation 4, the Sony PlayStation Network...Sony holds back the speed on everyone’s connection, there’s nothing I can do about that.\\n@VerizonSupport Trying it now, thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport Hi again. Just to let you know the activation link didn\\'t work. System said the details were incorrect even though I rechecked them. Tried using the chat function to get help but the person there said they couldn\\'t help. Referred me back to the 1-800.

Newburgh NY\\n@VerizonSupport @247168 This would have been a better first response 🙄 ours says all good too.\\n@VerizonSupport @247167 What good is that if it\\'s not accurate?   Many channels out in NYC - and logging in, status says \"ALL GOOD\" https://t.co/jdC9Vuwe07\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon wireless mobile\\n@VerizonSupport Ok thank you for letting me know. At least I can hAng up. I’ve been on hold for 33 minutes for tech support!!!\\n@VerizonSupport NY\\n@VerizonSupport Raleigh North Carolina. My boyfriend also has verizon with perfect signal sitting right next to me.

The problem seems to have been fixed in both counties.\\n@VerizonSupport Scarsdale NY\\n@VerizonSupport 5 feet\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I have to restart it around every 20 minutes.  I have also tried different modem/routers and they all do the same thing.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport There are only 2 mine and one from a neighbor across the street I have change the channel so t is not the same as there\\'s\\n@VerizonSupport Does not help I have done in the past makes no difference. I can however connect my neighbors it works fine for days but they are on Xfinity\\n@VerizonSupport Every device on wifi has the same problem. No device is mor than 25 feet from the rougher and the have at least 85 % signal strength\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, numerous times\\n@VerizonSupport New @115858 MacBook Pro. Reset router many times. Not on VPN. Only 5 feet away from an unobstructed @115725 router\\n@VerizonSupport The service interruption resolved itself after an hour b4 anyone @115722 @VerizonSupport took my call. I have to admit, #FIOS #CustomerService has gone down hill since I switched from TWC. On average I wait an hour 2 get 2 a live person &amp; this attempt went unanswered. #fail\\n@VerizonSupport It works in a couple of rooms,  but not this one..says no signal\\n@VerizonSupport I did..and it says  no outages  in area. .\\n@VerizonSupport So when will we receive bill credits since @115722 knows we cannot use the service during this time? \"Working on it\" is not a sufficient response.\\n@VerizonSupport I believe it was a problem with gone type of outage. I never spoke to anyone and was on hold for 56 min when the tv seemed to be fixed\\n@VerizonSupport Forget it now, I waited on hold for an hour and 10 minutes because my cable wasn’t working.\\n@VerizonSupport No channels would load on any boxes even after hard resets. Over an hour on hold for no one to ever come to the phone I’m just fed up\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Very weak signal\\n@VerizonSupport Nope\\n@VerizonSupport ??\\n@VerizonSupport I did that. And my download is 942.81 and upload is 895.95 but when I run a test on MacBook I only get 193.83 download and 280.90 upload\\n@VerizonSupport 5G\\n@VerizonSupport HONESTLY IDK CAUSE IT GOSE OUT FOR LIKE 3-5 secs AND EVEN IF I WANTED TO USE MY OTHER ROUTER I CANT CAUSE YOU ROUTER MESSES WITH MY GOOD GAMING ROUTER YALL HAVE.

My problem is w/ my cell phone coverage. That\\'s what the original screenshot is from.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, the only other Brooklyn location was further away. The incorrect address was close, the correct address was over a mile further...the new router has same issue, so a tech is coming tomorrow. Any chance of getting a credit on my account for the $50 I didn\\'t have to spend?\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 ok well can someone please help me activate the phone i have the info for the system admin\\n@VerizonSupport Can you DM me?\\n@VerizonSupport cell\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport Please resend link.

Is there anyone who can help?\\n@VerizonSupport I’m attempting to return the extender you all sent; however, the return label wasn’t included. @115817 wouldn’t accept it.\\n@VerizonSupport NY. The picture is black, laggy, pixilated - unwatchable.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. I don’t understand, I complained before about this. A technician need to come a take a good look at the outside connections, because it keeps disconnecting. I took a picture earlier went I was using my computer. https://t.co/ePAXnSa0wT\\n@VerizonSupport My internet is not working.\\n@VerizonSupport No, only internet\\n@VerizonSupport MA\\n@VerizonSupport Residential\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve sent a summary of events to @115990\\n@VerizonSupport You didn\\'t fix anything.  The issue fixed on its own after a number of hours and after I waited on hold for an hour but couldn\\'t get in touch with anyone.  I ask again, how are you going to make this right?\\n@VerizonSupport I need u guy to check if there is any problem with the internet\\n@VerizonSupport Speed test website won’t load, it just keeps refreshing itself\\n@VerizonSupport But it does the same in Safari too\\n@VerizonSupport Previous message states that I did reboot router...cleared the cache, no other devices using internet wireless or WiFi\\n@VerizonSupport This broadband speed test website could be used for a really boring rave\\n@VerizonSupport Shockingly the only thing resetting chrome meant was starting my transfer over from scratch\\n@VerizonSupport I live in an apartment building and your link doesn’t work\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve tried both, even restarted my router\\n@VerizonSupport Thank the Gods! Honestly, I stopped checking after three weeks.  Got tired of looking and finding nothing.\\n@VerizonSupport The browser says there is no internet connection\\n@VerizonSupport The earth icon is red, but the wifi icon is white\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure\\n@VerizonSupport I only have the router and the verizon TV box\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/OAP0Dy2HIu\\n@VerizonSupport This is the only button I found. It’s on the router https://t.co/EZ9dpt7ZmP\\n@VerizonSupport There is this black box with ‘ONT’ on it. Is it the battery backup unit?\\n@VerizonSupport I can’t find the button https://t.co/a5zuzXPrS6\\n@VerizonSupport Is this the button? https://t.co/0N49S5AsHR\\n@VerizonSupport It works now. Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile\\n@VerizonSupport Giving it a try now thanks\\n@VerizonSupport Still didn\\'t work I think our router isn\\'t functioning right.\\n@VerizonSupport Green but our service is little to no connection on all of our devices we have to plug in Ethernet cords\\n@VerizonSupport Friday\\n@VerizonSupport We are going to call tomorrow\\n@VerizonSupport No that\\'s the device the runs everything?\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah the whole process..\\n@VerizonSupport What\\'s going on with wifi service in northeast Philadelphia area?\\n@VerizonSupport Everything in the house is Wi-Fi\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Tried that.  Drops out all the time\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s been ok for that last 2 hours.  Frustrating how it drops out at random times every day.  Only fix is rebooting the router\\n@VerizonSupport Just the usual 2 of us\\n@VerizonSupport Shouldn\\'t you know that as my tech support?\\n@VerizonSupport Everything looks like it\\'s working great then crashes and we have to pull power\\n@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport i want your guys internet so bad I just got off the phone with you guys and I’m so upset to hear that you guys don’t offer Fios at my zip code area 75223 is there any alternatives ???😭😭😭\\n@VerizonSupport Would you kindly PM me more details please?\\n@VerizonSupport @253395 Been a customer for 5 years and it’s worth every penny. Very consistent service. https://t.co/zK4t7WF3Fe\\n@VerizonSupport Problem ultimately resolved...but it shouldn\\'t be so hard (and long) to place an order for new service\\n@VerizonSupport Okay I’ll try it\\n@VerizonSupport Still isn’t working :( I just turned my tv off for the night\\n@VerizonSupport No just one tv and one box. Can I speak to a live representative on Sunday or do I have to call Monday\\n@VerizonSupport How long should I leave it unplugged for? That was the first thing I tried but maybe I didn’t do it long enough...?\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport Ok I got it thanks. You the MVP\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah I think so\\n@VerizonSupport The globe light on my router is solid red.. again\\n@VerizonSupport Home internet\\n@VerizonSupport New mobile phone\\n@VerizonSupport Need some help\\n@VerizonSupport 3.0 wired someone came to my house on your end, said if i want better net “i have to move a couple miles” which im not finna do all that\\n@VerizonSupport My husband gave up for the night. Will try again tomorrow. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport My cell, horrible\\n@VerizonSupport No link was sent.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes the SD feed is the same.  Guess it my be how the feed is coming to FiOS?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes that still frame is from the national commercial break on Ch 694 POP.\\nIt shows up on all TV\\'s and only on that channel so it\\'s not an issue at the house.\\n@VerizonSupport Cell\\n@VerizonSupport Yes unplugged it as well\\n@VerizonSupport It’s red\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Yea sorry figured that out\\n@VerizonSupport Won\\'t even work on tablet now. I Pad keeps saying I have to update it. Have done 20 times. Still won\\'t connect. Always been hopeless. On tablet, won\\'t run on HDMI cable to TV either.\\n@VerizonSupport Of course. I am very computer literate. This is a problem that has been going on ever since your mobile app came into being. I\\'ve been through this with you dozens of times now!\\n@VerizonSupport I hv sent email,twetted but there s no reply from yahoo\\n@VerizonSupport seems to be just one\\n@VerizonSupport Can’t order PPVs ever since I moved. 3 times you guys told me it was fixed and it hasn’t\\n@VerizonSupport Oh wait they hung up on me AGAIN\\n@VerizonSupport Your rep, Michael (V702164) was able to fix the issue!! After 3 weeks on the phone he was the only rep able to fix the issue, PLEASE make sure he gets taken care of!!\\n@VerizonSupport yeah my wifi doesn’t work and neither does LTE\\n@VerizonSupport By the way my issue is Billing. If you\\'re technical support, please don\\'t waste my time. It\\'s going to make me more mad\\n@VerizonSupport If I DM you, you CANNOT tell me to call customer service. I need this issue resolved IMMEDIATELY. If you can\\'t help me right here on DM, then dont bother\\n@VerizonSupport Yes we have all 3 services. Not in an apartment. Battery backup costs extra, no extra $ for that.\\n@VerizonSupport Service is back. Outage in the area....\\n@VerizonSupport We have no battery backup unit\\n@VerizonSupport Probably both but definitely TV. Multiple TVs multiple stations.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, but sometimes you want to watch 1 good game. We have the Jet game and they suck. I hate how redzone flashes between games when you want to watch one good game. Patriots, Steelers &amp; Philly super bowl teams and we never ever get those games. Theyre east coast teams.\\n@VerizonSupport Payed for iphone cash receipt was handed over but phone was not because of weird additional charges. So i asked for money back but did not get it. Left store with no phone and no money. Basically feel robbed!\\n@VerizonSupport Live tv\\n@VerizonSupport Only MTV and has happened for a week across multiple shows / movies\\n@VerizonSupport Ok I have\\n@VerizonSupport Freezes. Only channel that does it.\\n@VerizonSupport All TV’s\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t believe so. Why would it be only one channel? Ideas?\\n@VerizonSupport It’s not great , why is my stuff not working ! My cable has no signal and my WiFi and phone is not working wtf\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t know what that is\\n@VerizonSupport Duh .. I called Verizon last night they said that they are having an outage and the cable should’ve back working at 1:30 am , it’s still not on\\n@VerizonSupport same service, skyrocketing cost. especially insulting when new customers are offered WAY better deals.  I\\'ve had enough.\\n@VerizonSupport We’ve done it multiple times!\\n@VerizonSupport Nope, it doesn’t come up at all\\n@VerizonSupport I can but there’s no picture. There’s sound though\\n@VerizonSupport BAD CABLE?! Are you on crack? This is a new box, less than 6 months old. There’s nothing wrong with it. Send a signal or something please I don’t have time for this\\n@VerizonSupport Nope just one incoming line\\n@VerizonSupport We tried that but it’s still not working\\n@VerizonSupport The picture would show for like half a second then I’d get this screen. I can hear it though just no picture https://t.co/8cfbKTBxex\\n@VerizonSupport Just the cable box https://t.co/y56V9kF7Ch\\n@VerizonSupport Yes red globe light I disconnected it last night and reset it as well and this morning too and nothing\\n@VerizonSupport The battery pack has a green light on\\n@VerizonSupport Its back! Thank you! What do you think was the problem?\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I cant even stream a Video, thats how bad it is 🤬\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I’ve tightened the coax cable. It works in the living room always, but the issues occur in the 2 bedrooms.\\n@VerizonSupport I did\\n@VerizonSupport New week same result. Full refund please. https://t.co/5H79r7LtTT\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Always has been\\n@VerizonSupport Tried that multiple times\\n@VerizonSupport I only have one box so yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Brooklyn. There’s no customer support line on Sunday?\\n@VerizonSupport Tried both safari and chrome browsers and same issue on both. You’re website is a mess\\n@VerizonSupport TV glitching but all other services seem OK. Trying third reset now.\\n@VerizonSupport We got a message that our system was resetting and to click ok. If didn\\'t work supposed to call. No help there. Manual reset did work.\\n@VerizonSupport Right now all seems ok. Thx for checking\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport No just television not the WiFi internet\\n@VerizonSupport Turn it back on with the remote\\n@VerizonSupport Yes that’s correct\\n@VerizonSupport Nope it’ll turn off but turn back on regularly when we use the remote\\n@VerizonSupport Usually occurs when listening to the music channels. The cable box turns off, when we turn it back on it doesn’t resume playing the same music channel, it goes back to the previous channel that was being viewed. Not the press menu screen\\n@VerizonSupport Will try this and report back\\n@VerizonSupport 👍🏻 thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport I just called cause I wanted to order a package and called several times. Last time ended up hanging up. I dialed the Spanish line and NOPE, didn’t get anything. Gave him our info and he had it and because I gave him several PIN numbers he didn’t do it.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport A tech came today and fixed the issue. It only took 4 weeks for them to send someone 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ A month we paid for really bad svc and NO high def and even some of the regular stations didn’t work. We’ve been customers for about 11 years. I was pretty disappointed.\\n@VerizonSupport “Sorry you are not authorized to view this content”. Only on Apple TV. Works on iPad and on my Fios box.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes - at first it displayed a message that our area was experiencing an outage for that channel and it would be back at 2:04pm.  But hasnt worked all day\\n@VerizonSupport No other channels are affected.  No message at all no on Red Zone - just a frozen image of previous channel.\\n@VerizonSupport Still no go.  I do get the below now https://t.co/aCGh7wsQCJ\\n@VerizonSupport Only Red Zone - same message on other boxes\\n@VerizonSupport We\\'re passed that now.  This is 3 weekends in a row now where you haven\\'t fixed our issue.  Please look at reference # inc00487759.  If my redzone isn\\'t turned on in the next hour we will be cancelling our service.\\n@VerizonSupport Think so\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks. You guys took care of it!\\n@VerizonSupport My 3rd box in 2 months just went bad. This is ridiculous for the amount I pay each month.\\n@VerizonSupport Because it was ridiculous. Twenty dollars savings. 289 down to 269. No thanks. You have no \"deals\" for long term loyal customers and I\\'ll remember that. Adios.\\n@VerizonSupport Hey, you had the deal to let me test streaming. I appreciate it.\\n@VerizonSupport The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.\\n\\nOver and over again. Only on bill pay. It\\'s as if, it doesn\\'t want us to pay our bill. Considering your company cannot even change bill due dates, at the very least the website should work.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. It’s only the pay bill portion of the website. Garbage website.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. And that\\'s great, because since your company seems to not be able to move bill due dates, it\\'s overdue every single month. \"There was an error retrieving your bill. Please try again later\". Yet, I can lock in a new rate no problem! Garbage. Website. Get it together.\\n@VerizonSupport the same. cannot retreive bill. internal server error.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport You guys can call me so I don\\'t wait on hold.\\n@VerizonSupport i need someone to call me\\n@VerizonSupport wireless\\n@VerizonSupport So instead of checking for an outage first, it makes more sense to have me try a bunch of random things for an hour that didn’t work?\\n@VerizonSupport I was told yesterday I could, then I call back and get the run around, departments closed, etc\\n@VerizonSupport Nice response time!\\n@VerizonSupport We are saving $100+/month over what we used to have with you guys. It was even cheaper for me to end my contract early and pay the fee.\\n@VerizonSupport The business hours phone agent said January 15th line restore instead of 7-10 days like the online and off-hours tech support we\\'re telling me. Again, my neighbor on my floor has Verizon dsl. And it\\'s working. My building is 5 minutes away from Verizon headquarters.\\n@VerizonSupport Business team on the phone said Jan 15. I guess that\\'s what you believe is \"assistance\". I have an entire building with half of the tenants having Verizon. I guess all 50-60 tenants in my building are on different lines.\\n@VerizonSupport Wasn\\'t useful the first time. Why don\\'t you escalate this matter to a supervisor in business accounts. Have them reply here or email or phone (cell, of course). I don\\'t need to sit through chat, explain again and have them tell me to call in to tell me Jan 15, again.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes HR doesn’t handle much they just refer us to speak to the head leaders over our supervisors and they just tell us we’ll look into it\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon Center, Etech Dallas, Tx Etech is a third party call center\\n@VerizonSupport Who would I need to contact because if my voice will not be heard I will report to the EEOC and take further actions I’m sorry but I can’t\\n@VerizonSupport I work for a third party call center though it seems that what’s going on up there Verizon doesn’t know anything that’s going on.\\n@VerizonSupport Tripple play with 1gig service Phone and whole home dvr. Now I called in cause I come from direct tv genie so I asked about dvr whole home\\n@VerizonSupport Is there any other way? How could this have happened?\\n@VerizonSupport Okay I\\'ll do that, but how is it possible the 5ghz connection can work but not the 2.4? I haven\\'t done anything to the router\\n@VerizonSupport No, straight to the router\\n@VerizonSupport I haven\\'t reset it yet, but still no. I\\'ll do it in the morning and get back to you\\n@VerizonSupport Personal settings as in a custom router name and password? If so yes I do have that, but they were set months ago\\n@VerizonSupport Yep. Network still shows up but I can\\'t connect to it\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, my 5ghz connection is working just fine but my laptop only connects to 2.4ghz. My phone can\\'t connect to the 2.4 either\\n@VerizonSupport You\\'re unaware you bill wireless &amp; business together? I think I\\'ll pass on the \\'help\\'. Can\\'t wait for you to try &amp; charge me for cancelling.\\n@VerizonSupport Area? You mean location or do you mean type of service?\\n@VerizonSupport in the future will the service?\\n@VerizonSupport Well who does control it?  Clearly neither Pittsburgh nor Florida are local markets for NY.  Does someone need a geography lesson?\\n@VerizonSupport Signed up for Fios. Too many times Comcast have fed the bullshit line of “I just saw an email about at getting pushed out”.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes that’s how I know the price changed.\\n@VerizonSupport You sure? Because the speeds state other wise. How can download be lower than upload at full bars. https://t.co/HLV2Q5CaO9\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and we’ve reset that when resetting the router\\n@VerizonSupport Wasn’t too bad of a hold time - got it all sorted, thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport How\\'s your day going?\\n@VerizonSupport I pressed it for 20 seconds and it doesn\\'t look like anything happened\\n@VerizonSupport is this the unit i should be looking at? Replace battery is red, but system status is green https://t.co/TptihMfX5q\\n@VerizonSupport we lost power this morning &amp; when it came back, our phones, WiFi, and FiOS didn\\'t. my mom spent two hours on the phone trying to figure out how to fix it herself. apparently the next available appointment is Friday morning. my mom and I both work from home &amp; need remote access\\n@VerizonSupport No, will have to schedule a separate appointment after consulting with a technician. The technician agreed that customer service was incorrect - hope this doesn\\'t happen to anyone else. Thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport I have been having issues with main cable box and internet for over a year. Customer service on the phone unhelpful - tries to sell me an upgraded box. Finally just had a knowledgeable technician come today - told me it\\'s the wiring and an upgraded box will not fix the issue.\\n@VerizonSupport Support Net Neutrality and I\\'ll stay with your service. Otherwise I\\'ll be canceling my service.  Happy Thanksgiving!\\n@VerizonSupport Hi, I have already done that but I was wondering if you have an ETA; I didn’t see one on the website...\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, And it didn’t work.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes bundle was 139 now its 169\\n@VerizonSupport Okay. This time I\\'ll put those chat screenshots here instead of DM so we\\'re all in the clear.\\n@VerizonSupport Still have messaging and the like, no Wi-Fi though. I have an essay due tomorrow and need the Wi-Fi 😩😩\\n@VerizonSupport cellular\\n@VerizonSupport @269326 Help is here?  How?  By taking away our internet freedom?\\n@VerizonSupport @269326 The fact that the current FCC chair used to work for Verizon says a lot. I do blame your greedy corporation for his irresponsible &amp; ignorant decisions. He’s clearly a corp shrill of yours\\n\\nYou will get a lot of complaints over this, but understand it’s not abt the service\\n@VerizonSupport Jk it hasn’t been a week I’m dramatic. But still curious\\n@VerizonSupport Why is your company supporting the FCC in Net Neutrality being revoked???? No longer a customer as of today.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I was, thank you.  Sorry about the mix up.  My Verizon is for wireless and my fios is for fios obviously.  Have a good thanksgiving.\\n@VerizonSupport Looking to change from Cablevision to fios\\n@VerizonSupport Looking to speak with a representative # change\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/BW1SyvQkB5\\n@VerizonSupport Where is this button located?\\n@VerizonSupport Just tested it and the outlet does have power\\n@VerizonSupport The PWR, BAT, DATA, NTWK, and MGMT are the only ones on\\n@VerizonSupport This is what I see https://t.co/4SL1u163O6\\n@VerizonSupport Still doesn’t work\\n@VerizonSupport I have access to it. I tried unplugging and replugging and still didn’t work.\\n@VerizonSupport Have done this 30 times but will try again\\n@VerizonSupport I just did and DMd please call or I need to cancel services\\n@VerizonSupport Please make it right.  This experience has been awful.\\n@VerizonSupport Cell phone and laptop, yes. I don\\'t know who to call to fix it\\nAnd when I go to sign in the page won\\'t load\\n@VerizonSupport You can DM me, I’m sure no one wants to hear about the experience I have been having\\n@VerizonSupport thank you, but it\\'s still happening. I hit the DVR button, screen \\'DVR Messages\\' shows. Upgrade or Cancel. Cancel just goes back to TV, Upgrade goes to the DVR Upgrade screen where I can either Exit for Live TV or Ok to Select a $12/mo upgrade which I don\\'t want.\\n@VerizonSupport I only have one dvr.\\n@VerizonSupport I aready sent messages\\n@VerizonSupport Always cellular. https://t.co/ivkwlM95JZ\\n@VerizonSupport says system error\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I need you to unlock my account so I can register an account online\\n@VerizonSupport Likely not symmetrical, but for a pretty huge savings I would take the compromise easily. I think I last spoke a few months ago, when my bill had reached $250 per month.\\n@VerizonSupport That would be great. Let’s do it!\\n@VerizonSupport Yep!\\n@VerizonSupport This was for cell phones. It was someone who is an employee replying to someone on Facebook regarding the difference in a Corp store vs them\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless.\\n@VerizonSupport The speed test page keeps automatically reloading because it can’t believe how slow my WiFi is. https://t.co/TYRzPvIHxk\\n@VerizonSupport Just didnand it’s doing the same thing. Only this time it’ll refresh every 10 seconds instead of every 5.\\n@VerizonSupport Doesn\\'t that negate the advantages of wireless? My question was are the speeds I\\'m getting the norm for wifi?\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks but been testing since install. Wired speed very good 99/101, wireless 42.10/84.47 on channel 6. Changed from channel 1. Happy Thanksgiving!\\n@VerizonSupport So what is considered acceptable wifi speeds if I have 100/100? That question was not answered.\\n@VerizonSupport 2.5,  but Spectre x360 15 on the way soon, then 5G\\n@VerizonSupport Not until the x360 gets here, My current 4yr old HP does not support it. Thanks for the support, enjoy tomorrow!\\n@VerizonSupport None, I have Quantum Gateway router\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless, it\\'s a residential connection.\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t have a cable I just moved.

But we have had trouble with the line over the last few weeks\\n@VerizonSupport thank you!! it\\'s a coaxile cord!\\n@VerizonSupport Oh yes there is one of those!!\\n@VerizonSupport Every. Single. Thing. For an hour. Just bought the season on @115821 and am watching on my @127972 because it’s 9:20pm and I don’t feel like troubleshooting. Will be switching to Comcast on Friday.\\n@VerizonSupport Already following. DMing now\\n@VerizonSupport This. Not to mention I’ve been getting an error message on no less than 4 HD channels on a separate box. For the almost $400/mo we’ve been paying for years it would be nice if things actually worked. https://t.co/dsCiQvzPDT\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ll DM now, but I suspect it might be the router. I noticed one of the sides was kind of opened, so I\\'m thinking it fell.\\n@VerizonSupport I already checked that. I followed the steps on the trouble shooter. Didn\\'t help.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you 💪👏\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you. It happened a couple of weeks ago and now today with a Verizon Customer\\n@VerizonSupport We’ve done all that, we’ve rebooted too and nothing still works. And why should we have to continually do this? It’s ridiculous!\\n@VerizonSupport @30421 will DM you. But don’t reboot my system because I’m recording!\\n@VerizonSupport Great news! 90 Day Fiancé episode 20 is now available but the sound cuts out near the beginning and doesn’t come back on.

Like seriously you guys think you guys can make people pay for websites. The internet should be a free place for people to talk and communicate with each other. But now I guess we can’t because of you people.\\n@VerizonSupport This isn’t something I can chat back and forth about, I need to speak to someone over the phone and was promised a call back.  Let me know when I can talk to somebody.\\n@VerizonSupport Never have had such a horrible experience!  Hours and several phone calls later no solution.\\n@VerizonSupport Really?  You’re so quick to answer online but I’ve been on hold for over an hour\\n@VerizonSupport Nobody can assist me with managing my fios accounts and tv channels\\n@VerizonSupport I was promised showtime at a certain cost and everyone I dealt with for my account handled it poorly - I was just on hold for 2 hours waiting for a supervisor\\n@VerizonSupport I’m waiting to speak to a manager about the account we started today, and they promised a call within 1-2 hours and it’s been longer.  I need someone’s assistance.\\n@VerizonSupport No. That\\'s why I want to talk to someone.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m seeing ads for triple play at 79.99/month and I\\'m paying 119.99. How do I move over?\\n@VerizonSupport Wanted to talk to you to see if I could lower my monthly bill\\n@VerizonSupport 07070\\n@VerizonSupport TY as an acct Mgr for a med-size corp &amp; personal acct holder, I just told @Ask_Spectrum rep I can\\'t    Recommend for my company or myself\\n@VerizonSupport I checked you guys are in my area, i will call and order fios either Thursday morning or Friday, its a dam shame @115955 having family over and can\\'t even watch/surf anything. #ThanksgivingFail\\n@VerizonSupport Already talked to you guys. Said you\\'d send a technician over Saturday. Kinda trash but whatever\\n@VerizonSupport Cell. There was a fraud purchase on my account that should have been removed over a month ago.\\n@VerizonSupport 2123342170 is our business line but the PHONE DOESNT WORK so you can call me on my cell 3474663180\\n@VerizonSupport Ok\\n@VerizonSupport Quoted a price, agreed to and then not honored. Call for help fixing wires, no work done at all.\\n@VerizonSupport Keep hearing that from your phone support and they constantly try to upsell and add services.\\n@VerizonSupport I believe after the rude agent on the phone yesterday I am going to cancel my service, she was mean and nasty.\\n@VerizonSupport I can call customer support twice and get two different answers to the same question and both tend to be inaccurate\\n@VerizonSupport Internet is fine, just zero TV channels working.\\n@VerizonSupport Rebooted the entire system before calling last night. Same error showing. See attached. https://t.co/jc64pBAryC\\n@VerizonSupport The error means that cable card is not working. I don’t know if I need a system reset signal sent or a new cable card.\\n@VerizonSupport Had to wait until someone home, coax reseated, error same. Can we try refresh signal, can’t do it thru app w a CableCard. I can DM acct#\\n@VerizonSupport All TV channels stopped working last night. Not working as I left for work this morning. Have an error msg on my TiVo “searching for signal”\\n@VerizonSupport I already disconnected my service because I thought I was not in contract, I even called verizon prior to canceling just to make sure\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I need you guys to waived my contract fee like your reps promised\\n@VerizonSupport I was told my contract was up and you guys are charging me cancellations fees...how are you going to fix this?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'d like for my contract that was extended without my knowledge to be cancelled (as promised) and for the 210 fee to be waived...simple\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Honestly I’m tired of contacting people with your company. No one gives a fuck and it’s pretty clear. If you did I’d have my money back.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless service\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m curious. You people really do know that just about every device is connected wirelessly, right? You just ask that to try to avoid responsibility, right? Wireless, using Verizon\\'s POS router!\\n@VerizonSupport No. But, I did reset your router and this is the result. THIS is what I pay your outrageous rates for, even after the next troubleshooting test, the router reset. https://t.co/zc9MSfafsG\\n@VerizonSupport Your YouTube live video just says error every time we try to play it\\n@VerizonSupport North Georgia 30528\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and on msg go mobile app . Thanks you for your attention and reply\\n@VerizonSupport It’s always when we try to watch something on demand... either it is pixelated or blurred and we can’t watch the show.

Doesn’t help....\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/f53HD0FJvp\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and yes\\n@VerizonSupport Spoke with some supervisor named Lala (in the Philippines) and supposedly straightened it out. I’ve also been trying to stop your voicemail turned off, I have my own machine. I’ve had to set my machine on three rings so it beats your service and it’s too fast for me too.\\n@VerizonSupport Frustration... form of punishment?.\\n@VerizonSupport I tagged you in a different tweet with my issue\\n@VerizonSupport Whole network out- 5X in 20 days...restored ea time pending equipment update. Your rep refused to troubleshoot inconsiderate of my frustration\\n@VerizonSupport I am in Tampa Fl\\n@VerizonSupport @Ask_Spectrum aww man that page just keeps looping to this page :( https://t.co/NZoZKuWa5s\\n@VerizonSupport @Ask_Spectrum Someone take my money!\\n@VerizonSupport Yah i got nothin.

No response.\\n@VerizonSupport I did. Then waited 45 minutes with no response from Verizon.\\n@VerizonSupport I know you have no intention in the near future to enter the Baltimore market.

To bad I can\\'t view the packages yet since my internet is down and my cell phone service usually gets slower when this happens\\n@VerizonSupport Does your DVR service record up to 6 shows at once?\\n@VerizonSupport Not available yet.\\n@VerizonSupport @143012 FiOS in my hometown in PA. These are really the best speeds you can offer? Where is the fiber you were paid by a grant to run to every home? Meanwhile I get 2Gbs down in Japan for $60 https://t.co/XYuAoDpQzy\\n@VerizonSupport DNS error. And yes, I\\'ve reset it and it\\'s plugged in.\\n@VerizonSupport Second day off in a month you guys have fucked up. Real bummer.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m tired of paying for this if it\\'s not going to work when i need it to, gang.\\n@VerizonSupport No just blinks a bit https://t.co/yX0D2t09Ox\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and that will fix it for a day or so, then i have to do it again.\\n@VerizonSupport Hell no.\\n@VerizonSupport Did that earlier. 0 success.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve been working on a phone insurance claim for literally 3 days now and it\\'s the biggest joke I\\'ve ever dealt with in my life\\n@VerizonSupport The previous two techs said they\\'d fixed it but it\\'s THREE MONTHS LATER and it\\'s STILL BROKEN and TECH IS NOT HERE!!\\n@VerizonSupport Also, you have been CHARGING ME for my BROKEN PHONE LINE.

Still haven’t been notified of anything. I can’t reschedule either (which I don’t even want to) because it says error whenever I try\\n@VerizonSupport Both. They didn’t provide me with the same time it’s saying online but regardless no one ever showed up.\\n@VerizonSupport ..... It\\'s listed on your website.\\nhttps://t.co/HcrhRxwHjq https://t.co/Pc7waTFLpL\\n@VerizonSupport I didn\\'t, although I received a call 5 minutes ago from New York, and he confirmed that he dialed that number.\\n@VerizonSupport one might accurately say, they are in the shitter.\\n@VerizonSupport My router is metaphorically on the toilet and your service is what\\'s coming out of it.\\n@VerizonSupport I had already tried in Chrome and Firefox. Tried again just now in Chrome and now it shows but still not in FF. Same addons on both 🤔\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Same link that\\'s highlighted in the first image.\\n@VerizonSupport Got a call from someone who wanted to tell me about how they were working a problem that I called about last week. He was indifferent\\n@VerizonSupport That when I tried to phone @115722 about On Demand problem no one ever picked up the phone. He said that\\'s impossible we\\'re aways here\\n@VerizonSupport You seem unconcerned that I\\'ve experienced a series of bad or nonexistent customer support. I want someone in charge to know about this.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I need for you to convey to someone that every time I try to contact @10309 by phone or Twitter or Chat I can\\'t get my problem resolved\\n@VerizonSupport Perhaps better discussed via inbox\\n@VerizonSupport Hello Humans! 🙌🏾. Problems with FIOS/home service. Help?\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile\\n@VerizonSupport How can they reach you on FB or can I direct message you a name and contact info? She is at her wits ends trying to get this done.\\n@VerizonSupport They’ve tried repeatedly to reach you. and you were a no show at two appointments. Frannkly, are tried of sitting on the phone.\\n@VerizonSupport Unless you can give me a number that will solve this, I’m advising her to file an FCC complaint. This is terrible customer service.\\n@VerizonSupport A general verizon number? She’s already spent hours with you at that number. How can you help her here?\\n@VerizonSupport This is an old woman who needs her landline for medical reasons.  Very unacceptable.\\n@VerizonSupport Again, someone from Verizon should be calling HER not the other way around. They have spent hours calling YOU.\\n@VerizonSupport I understand but I am sure they are done trying to reach Verizon. I think you may be hearing from the FCC about this matter.\\n@VerizonSupport I am authorized to give you her daughter in law’s name and number by direct message.  She is handing this for her mother in law.\\n@VerizonSupport Well, what information do you need? perhaps I can supply it to you via direct message.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport TV is in and out. Internet is out. I called and they have a rep coming in the morning. It was installed 6 hours ago and it\\'s already useless\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport About 90% of the time I get an error like this.

Reseting is by holding the Silence Alarm button for 15 seconds?\\n@VerizonSupport YES.. You can look through my replies, someone else around my area had the SAME issue.. Please do something.

No help. Help me please.\\n@VerizonSupport Supposed to be on BeinSports. What channel is that? I found on 1643 but it’s in sd and in Spanish. It’s 2017. Why is ther still SD???????\\n@VerizonSupport Oh I\\'m aware. Go figure that sports channel isn\\'t part of the sports package. But I get QVC and HSN!\\n@VerizonSupport are y’all gonna follow back?\\n@VerizonSupport Black screen.\\n@VerizonSupport Signed in and does not show any outages in my area. How do I report an outage?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I have all three services with Verizon. Just upgraded to the highest internet speed about a week ago.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes power is good. Cycled it too. Indicator lights are active.\\n@VerizonSupport No luck with that suggestion. So frustrating.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes - status light is green. Tech guy on phone said no issues on your end - but it was working fine - and then it wasn\\'t.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Holding now. Beeped twice.\\n@VerizonSupport I disconnected it and then lost service. I plugged it back in in case that was the cause but still no luck.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes just the top green light.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. Back with tech support. :(\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t know if you can relay messages - but thank you all here and special thanks to Ponnada for getting me all squared away!\\n@VerizonSupport aaaaaaand all my recordings are gone\\n@VerizonSupport That’s the only one hooked to FiOS (the others are just “smart”). All of their channels are normal.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks. Will try tomorrow.\\n@VerizonSupport @32501 (HD516) is back on this morning. Thanks for the response! Hope it doesn’t go blank for #ArrowSeason6 premiere!\\n@VerizonSupport Where do I send or take it?\\n@VerizonSupport If it’s actually worth it to you are really sincere then you would work with me to get an actually legit price. Otherwise it’s not worth it\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, and they are laughably expensive. I’m not paying $100 for that service. Rather take the ETF and get the better for less elsewhere.\\n@VerizonSupport For caring about my loyalty the people on the phone didn’t even ask why I was disconnecting. Not even a small try to keep me. Just “when?”\\n@VerizonSupport So you’d rather lose my business entirely then give me a decent price. Ok then. Have it your way.\\n@VerizonSupport Because “new” is better than “loyal”. Like I said, Comcast is coming and I’m not “loyal” enough at this point. It’s absurd how you price.\\n@VerizonSupport I’m annoyed that you keep saying I’m a “loyal” customer yet try to charge me $75 more a month for the same service.\\n@VerizonSupport This LTE internet has been SLOWWWWW I have 3 iPhone 7plus on this account and the internet is slow on them all\\n@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport my remote stopped working. Was told a new one would be mailed to me but received no email confirmation. Was calling to check\\n@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport if I give you my  email can you check?\\n@VerizonSupport mobile.\\n@VerizonSupport No Verizon Residential Online Chat for the Contact us campaign\\n@VerizonSupport 75247 Frontier migrated TX, FL, &amp; CA so it’s only Wireless in TX\\n@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport I have an outstanding debt  with you guys bc @115955 came back on hours later, and I was too young nd stupid 2 cancel 😩\\n@VerizonSupport That was main reason for call. Now I have now dvr and they want to charge me an additional 20$ I am still waiting on call from a manager sup\\n@VerizonSupport For 20+ mins. I shut it down.\\n@VerizonSupport So I just retightened it, and now the pixelated channel changed! Also, don\\'t have another TV.\\n@VerizonSupport No. Most, but not all as described previously.\\n@VerizonSupport Internet service\\n@VerizonSupport So I guess you\\'ll need to send a technician here to deal with it.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Coax is perfect and in tightly. Some channels are perfectly crisp. Others not. https://t.co/mDhNqNPo1Y\\n@VerizonSupport The internet service, and direct feed of basic TV, have been very choppy. This video is of live TV on your service. https://t.co/XRknXAbocd\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/TFv6fysXRs\\n@VerizonSupport I am, still will not load it. https://t.co/gedjFNWasa\\n@VerizonSupport no\\n@VerizonSupport No, it\\'s 12:30 in the morning &amp; I\\'m not about to start some troubleshooting ordeal, I just wanted to watch TV.

All cables are secure...\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, it is set to record now on Sunday, thanks again!!\\n@VerizonSupport But I was looking at DVR, will try app.\\n@VerizonSupport Yea\\n@VerizonSupport Done. Should the battery beep or anything after the 20swc depress.it did not. Also. Restart the modem after this?\\n@VerizonSupport Still red globe.\\n@VerizonSupport Looks like we have another outage. 4days later. https://t.co/awpPEagjEl\\n@VerizonSupport No I click on the show and it says that I timed out I don’t get to the episode list\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport No everything is having problems even free programs\\n@VerizonSupport No it’s white\\n@VerizonSupport On hbo on Demand\\n@VerizonSupport I’m trying to watch game of thrones\\n@VerizonSupport Its not coming to my area. You guys have already stop expanding your fios program.\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/jkymyCtURJ\\nThis right here shows that fios is not expanding. Its a shame, cause so many people would switch in a heart beat.\\n@VerizonSupport Look, the signal was messed up from you all coming into the house before the SPLITTER!  Nothing has changed in our house, nor moved\\n@VerizonSupport I have had this number for over 20 years.\\n@VerizonSupport I can pay my bill but I cannot set up an account. The system keeps asking for an order number and I don\\'t have one.\\n@VerizonSupport The https://t.co/5uGVKgFIss page. They also gave me a .net page. I spoke with Tiare for 30 minutes and then waited 10 for tech support.\\n@VerizonSupport We never connected because she was dropped from the chat. Then Jaime came on the line and after asking me all the same questions and waiting\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m proud to say I\\'m with u guys now\\n@VerizonSupport Nope . Just the home internet . The last 3 days we had short outrages.  Last night it went down and didn\\'t go back on\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/rvZMe5AwYa\\n@VerizonSupport Still nothing\\n@VerizonSupport One solid green light\\n@VerizonSupport I do , I did still nothing\\n@VerizonSupport Nope . No changes\\n@VerizonSupport I called customer service , they say they have an outage in our area\\n@VerizonSupport For example, why split CNN from MSNBC?\\n@VerizonSupport Sure do - cannot get the account management to work on any browser\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, iPhone7. Intermittently it will drop to dialup speeds, even in well covered areas.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport When we signed up for your service, nobody mentioned to us that the gift card could only be used with Verizon wireless.\\n@VerizonSupport I did receive a ticket number\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport @297268 So why don\\'t you? No internet for 12+ hours in the Poconos.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah that would be really cool, hopefully the Twitter bot is better!\\n@VerizonSupport Trying to buy new service. Fiber ops are installed, tho they drilled into my mattress from outside w/o warning. So far, v. unhappy w #Fios 🙄\\n@VerizonSupport You make it as difficult as possible for me to suspend my service for 5 months. Same price to keep my phones and Internet on.\\n@VerizonSupport Business trip switch off TV leave Internet and phones on. Barely no cost saving. 248 to 190 for merely Internet and phone.\\n@VerizonSupport Residential\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve spoken with Matthew on the phone and he was fantastic.\\n@VerizonSupport Cell\\n@VerizonSupport EVERYONE IS\\n@VerizonSupport yes on my cell phone. Its really abusive in nature, and they are using many phone numbers. I got 3 today morning.\\n@VerizonSupport Trying to find out which model of routers from third parties are viable for use with Verizon Fios internet and cable?\\n@VerizonSupport What is the make and model of your router? And, ANY router is good for internet WITH the Verizon router?\\n@VerizonSupport So, are you suggesting that it is IMPOSSIBLE to purchase a router from ANY other source BUT Verizon that will provide service to the home?\\n@VerizonSupport You CAN’T recommend a router that would populate the TV guide &amp; On Demand functions, or you won’t!? On the ones you sell/lease will!?\\n@VerizonSupport Again...I\\'ve NEVER lived in NJ but I\\'m told that I owe 1448 dollars for a land line there! How does THAT work!

I found the fix. Note to self. Cats can unplug cables sometimes when they run around\\n@VerizonSupport Fios.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, and your accounting department admitted it was a mistake on their end and said it would be handled yesterday.

We’ve spoken to multiple supervisors and have been told different things and that we’re to pay the difference\\n@VerizonSupport Yes they have. Each person we spoke to wouldn’t reverse the charges\\n@VerizonSupport No. I talked to two different people. Nobody helped.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, they didn\\'t help me.\\n@VerizonSupport He said someone would research and get back to me on Twitter.\\n@VerizonSupport The 1-800 number that redirects to our call center was disconnected on Friday – not sure why + we need to get it back up ASAP...\\n@VerizonSupport ...who can we contact?

Every. Single. Time. I deal with a Fios rep. 5/\\n@VerizonSupport I believe your policies result in pent-up frustration for your long-term customers.

I\\'m not sure what I\\'m looking for here\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/sv9NIxYMSD\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, my phone has been slower over wireless and my computer has been slower in Overwatch over a wired connection\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t think so\\n@VerizonSupport I linked the tracert hop where ping is going high, it\\'s affecting all blizzard games and discord ping for me\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/twRkloKO3v this is the trace route i did an hour ago with blizzard support. They said it didnt get past my modem\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/9KA2pH4y75\\n@VerizonSupport so what does that mean? just wait?\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry for the delay, wasn\\'t home! The television isn\\'t working, and we have fios. And yes, the earth symbol is red, the wifi is white.\\n@VerizonSupport I think we are looking at it now. The battery power light is blinking green. System status light is on. All other lights off. It\\'s beeping. https://t.co/I39GcUSj0t\\n@VerizonSupport Ok. It seemed like the outlet didn\\'t work. But we replugged in the battery box and now the OK light is on. I\\'ve rest the router to test it.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you! You guys are quick and efficient I appreciate it 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾\\n@VerizonSupport On hold for an hour for about the tenth time. On demand doesn\\'t work. 1/2\\n@VerizonSupport I hope help doesn\\'t start with rebooting the modem. Done that twice. Gets worse each time.\\n@VerizonSupport My DMs are open. Feel free to message me.\\n@VerizonSupport Also, to note, even attempting to watch a video stream is getting buffering and inability to keep a solid connection.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless I was getting that but my tests in the past were always 30-40\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m on 12-20 minute hold. This is after 30 minutes of unhelpful internet based troubleshooting.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for responding. It’s happening on all my games on PS4. I’m seeing that I’m not the only one with the issue\\n@VerizonSupport Wired. My internet also seems laggy\\n@VerizonSupport It looks like it’s fine, but my ping is still high. Blizzard said their servers are fine as well\\n@VerizonSupport Fluctuating internet connectivity for at least 3 hours now,  this is a widespread problem that I hope you guys are aware of by this point.\\n@VerizonSupport @400817 @400815 Lmaooooo\\n@VerizonSupport Cell service. Signed up for unlimited and now getting cancelled out.\\n@VerizonSupport Well I would have answered sooner but everything died  technician time. 4 hour wait. Yeah missed work\\n@VerizonSupport Nope at a restaurant. They came out got phone and tv working. But not internet\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, on different channels. What\\'s up with the internet as well?\\n@VerizonSupport In other words: this needs to be escalated ASAP and it\\'s not just a single incident affecting me but thousands of users.\\n@VerizonSupport Okay here\\'s the proof. https://t.co/AxJChPovWG\\n@VerizonSupport No I don\\'t know how to do that\\n@VerizonSupport How do you reboot the cable box??\\n@VerizonSupport I do. DM?\\n@VerizonSupport Windows 10 64 Bit that is up to date with an i7.\\n@VerizonSupport Appreciate it. I just want it fixed. If I can assist any more I will be happy to provide.\\n@VerizonSupport Alternatively, here\\'s a route that avoids that node. https://t.co/fzN1Xxu01f\\n@VerizonSupport how would you guys like me to send this to you? a screenshot over DM? i ran the tracert and its completed, i have the screenshot ready\\n@VerizonSupport Wifi is slowing down, always buffering videos.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, a couple of things, actually. Thanks for responding.\\n\\nCan you lower our bills and provide better fios service?\\n@VerizonSupport Okay, how about we see what bundles / deals you can offer?\\n@VerizonSupport Media stalling while on and off WiFi.\\n@VerizonSupport As far as I know I don\\'t think it lights up red every time I go check on it when I do loose internet and wireless it fine.\\n@VerizonSupport Hard wire meaning an ethernet cable? The yes. using a desktop hard wired to the rounter.\\n@VerizonSupport Are you talking about turning off my router and turning it back on bec I feel like the issue is more than that and yes I have a few times.\\n@VerizonSupport What does this do? Do I have to recreate something like password etc?\\n@VerizonSupport What do you mean by that?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m using everything from default so whatever came with the router.\\n@VerizonSupport This is any update for the router? Also Been hearing an internet outage on the East coast of NA is that true?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve lost so many internet connection than ever after upgrading my internet.\\n@VerizonSupport it does not go red. I stream on a site called Twitch and it happens there the most. I do get disconnected offstream as well but not as often\\n@VerizonSupport I have and they said they are working on the issue but I am also wonder if it is also Verizon as well causing the issue.\\n@VerizonSupport Are you guys working with Twitch? Because this is getting out of hand.\\n@VerizonSupport But this is only happening to people who have Verizon and if this keeps up people will take actions like switching ISP.\\n@VerizonSupport @118797 I have and if you see the comments everyone is saying their ISP is Verizon. Not trying to point any fingers I know they are working on it.\\n@VerizonSupport ran through blizzards central servers. I think it\\'s just blizzard. https://t.co/FgTqodb9sX\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, but that\\'s not the point.  My service was shut off with NO notice.  Do you not understand that?\\n@VerizonSupport NO. After a tech came in August &amp; we determined that it was not an option to rip my apartment apart I was never given an end of service date\\n@VerizonSupport Your apology is MEANINGLESS.  Restore my service for 30 days.\\n@VerizonSupport Not only have you inconvenienced me personally, I can not do my work because I work from home and now have NO internet.  This is an outrage\\n@VerizonSupport of course wireless, been a loyal 13 year customer, the Verizon screws me on watch phone. Very disappointing.\\n@VerizonSupport I have a traceroute if you want a dm?\\n\\'\\n@VerizonSupport now it is 100% slow speeds\\n@VerizonSupport High ping in my video games please help\\n@VerizonSupport Just gaming servers, usually https://t.co/YRZxLeryA5 is terrible to load streams also\\n@VerizonSupport No, regular verizon accounts: mdarweesh mjdarweesh __email__\\n@VerizonSupport residential\\n@VerizonSupport Only shows a few TV channels out.\\n@VerizonSupport N/m - weird internal problem that\\'s been fixed. Thanks for reaching out, though!\\n@VerizonSupport No there is no red light. I have a regular  connection and a 5G one. The 5G works perfectly on phones. Regular one won’t connect at all\\n@VerizonSupport Since today. My laptop and phone say “can’t connect to this network.” Yes, the password is correct. Yes, it worked yesterday\\n@VerizonSupport Ok it seems to be working. Why do things like these happen &amp; are they preventable\\n@VerizonSupport Are you going to restore my service for 30 days?  If not I have no reason to follow you.  I will continue to tweet govt officals &amp; media.\\n@VerizonSupport I spoke w/a Verizon tech outside my building today &amp; he said the copper lines are still very much in use.  So why was my service shut off?\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you.  I will not be bullied by Verizon &amp; be silent so I strongly suggest Verizon restore my service for 30 days for everyone\\'s sake.\\n@VerizonSupport I tried first with AC power unplugged and then tried with it plugged in. Both times failed.\\n@VerizonSupport There are no outages lol. But internet just always seems to go down around this time very often.\\n@VerizonSupport Maryland.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s a waste of my time cause you don\\'t understand nothing I am tired of lies and incompetence\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and nothing has been fixed\\n@VerizonSupport Business. Construction knocked out the lines yesterday morning\\n@VerizonSupport Cell\\n@VerizonSupport This is what I\\'m seeing.

Need network password for computers. Maybe DM that?\\n@VerizonSupport Think I\\'ve found it. Black. Lots of wires?\\n@VerizonSupport You mean the grey unit outside?\\n@VerizonSupport Oh and 2 chat sessions cut off due to network error, long hold times (well past what was expected) that resulted in nothing\\n@VerizonSupport Again all understandable factors, but is anything being done to increase speeds or do I need to start considering other options\\n@VerizonSupport Well that’s a shame feeding me lies over the years of the promise of more just to be told no now.\\n@VerizonSupport Understandable but I’ve been told that for many many many years why hasn’t there been any effort to increase it\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I’ve had the same services for 10+ years it’s the only option in my area. Why haven’t the speeds ever increased?\\n@VerizonSupport No home internet\\n@VerizonSupport So I just connect a Ethernet from the fios router to the NightHawk?\\n@VerizonSupport I am in Arizona. It is for a residential account.\\n@VerizonSupport The different addresses placed the hold and no one can seem to change my address and have my order processed. I\\'m a new customer\\n@VerizonSupport When I\\'m on my devices I expect speeds faster than 1... Really closer to 50. Time to switch providers I guess\\n@VerizonSupport The one that right on the iPhone https://t.co/a1AwGKS6ix\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/ZWNmp1luTA\\n@VerizonSupport I updated my shipping address and Verizon put in a ticket to return my package back to them instead.

I’ve stopped using verizon’s router and i want to send it back.\\n@VerizonSupport also, on the phone they said they wrote down when i first called so they can backdate my bill when they get the device. that’s true right?\\n@VerizonSupport So we have a business account that we do not get a dial tone for.\\n@VerizonSupport Brooklyn New York\\n@VerizonSupport As I said in my last tweet, I’m signed in. https://t.co/2U7LsmtENQ\\n@VerizonSupport I think like 8 or 9 months 😭\\n@VerizonSupport I did everything I got a box and a wire from ground\\n@VerizonSupport So if I forgot to record something that I wanted. I have to be home to record that channel ?\\n@VerizonSupport How? The channel does not appear in the mobile guide.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah\\n@VerizonSupport That really makes no sense. What’s the point of the mobile app if I have to be at home to use it?\\n@VerizonSupport Not this second\\n@VerizonSupport Your internet goes out at least twice a week\\n@VerizonSupport Yup and y’all sent me a new router last week. Still out\\n@VerizonSupport Just internet\\n@VerizonSupport I got this text from Verizon this morning and was just curious what \"the 96327 size\" is? https://t.co/9Z5uueHOwY\\n@VerizonSupport Cell, but i\\'ve chatted through the website before, and if my math works out, i\\'d like to place an order today\\n@VerizonSupport Follow me back so I can dm my issue\\n@VerizonSupport I cannot get any information about the outage, been on hold with FIOS for 90 minutes\\n@VerizonSupport We have FIOS phone and internet.

We had the best package available complained numerous times\\n@VerizonSupport October 9th contacted Verizon about phone being out and given appointment for 30. It’s now Nov 26th andNo one has come. Phones been out since. Two weeks ago internet went out no one has come no explanation. Customer for 11 years\\n@VerizonSupport Yes for next week Thursday\\n@VerizonSupport Please contact me. My landline isn’t working AGAIN and claims service is interrupted AGAIN\\n@VerizonSupport I believe copper. Your customer service is ridiculous. I’ve been waiting for a rep for 40 min when est time was FOUR min\\n@VerizonSupport Worst install in my 8 years with Verizon. Dude is rude, banged up my floors by throwing my cable box, and slammed equipment.\\n@VerizonSupport What shall I check on battery?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes...\\n@VerizonSupport Required rebooting router too, but we are back up now. Why so many having this issue in my area?\\n@VerizonSupport 12 hours later, #fios is still out.\\n@VerizonSupport WAN was orange during that time.\\n@VerizonSupport Just came back on (after being out one hour).\\n@VerizonSupport @406011 Still out here too.\\n@VerizonSupport @406012 In 20902 did this and it said no outages - but definitely out\\n@VerizonSupport I did.

I\\'ve been on hold for 30 minutes\\n@VerizonSupport My mom was having issues with her phone, customer service told her to do a factory reset, and assured that everything was saved to the cloud\\n@VerizonSupport When pushed about what happens the CS operator became very rude and it took us constantly telling her to not hang up so that she didn\\'t.\\n@VerizonSupport Hopefully! Number in DM\\n@VerizonSupport I am\\n@VerizonSupport Its more complicated.  Ive been on hold for 28 minutes for tech support.  Any clue how long the hold is tonight?\\n@VerizonSupport Still out.\\nNo dial tone.\\nNo updates.\\n:-(\\n@VerizonSupport Residential landline.\\n@VerizonSupport NY\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Was told it was weather related due to lightning strike last night somewhere in Suffolk Co.??\\n@VerizonSupport Then I seem to know more details than Verizon Support apparently!\\nOutrageous!!!😞\\n@VerizonSupport All calls to landline phone going directly to vmail\\n@VerizonSupport Smithtown, NY...\\n@VerizonSupport Tried DM, but got this error: \"This user doesn\\'t follow you.

Is there a private email or something secure where I contact you?\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile\\n@VerizonSupport I fixed it myself.\\n@VerizonSupport The way you treat people is insulting. I don\\'t have to give my number or name, or be referred to as \"John\", \"just because you need a name\"…\\n@VerizonSupport i have to wait till tomorrow till another tech comes to my house which is getting so tiring\\n@VerizonSupport I signed up for it the first day I joined\\n@VerizonSupport Cell\\n@VerizonSupport Did not work\\n@VerizonSupport Nice of @VerizonSupport to reply so promptly. Still nothing from the consistently awful service of @Ask_Spectrum...\\n@VerizonSupport I just wanted set top box reset. The unplugging &amp;automatic assistant couldn\\'t do it. Thanks for the response, but at this point, never mind.\\n@VerizonSupport I legitimately appreciate your quick response, but if you want to know why folks cancel, it\\'s because your system says to call &amp; then this.\\n@VerizonSupport Also, and this is admittedly a minor point common to all hold music, but it\\'s 2017; hold music shouldn\\'t sound like an AM radio in a well.\\n@VerizonSupport Residential. What should be a 5 minute call has turned into a 45 minute ordeal. Stop the do-it-yourself customer service and be human again\\n@VerizonSupport There\\'s an outage in my area.which I totally understand.but why not put an alert on the site..which I checked serval times before calling in\\n@VerizonSupport These were phone speeds on LTE. Service has been sluggish for weeks 2 the point of giving up until I’m on WiFi. I’ve reset network settings.\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t have Fios.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Beyond slow. To the point of giving up until I’m on wifi. My wife has the same issue. It’s very sporadic.\\n@VerizonSupport Cell\\n@VerizonSupport I did it says it cant process...Does that mean my credit isnt good enough ?\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, it\\'s just going to cost me more money to extend my current service another month. And another day wasted for them to show up. I told the rep that when I call Spectrum to extend if they offer me a deal I\\'ll probably just not switch - this is how you lose customers.\\n@VerizonSupport Continuing saga... just got off the phone with CS who told me they don\\'t have the deposit needed. Except I paid it 2 weeks ago according to Chase. #Thieves?\\n@VerizonSupport Supposedly, but I just re-upped with Spectrum - and I was told they won\\'t compensate me for the additional expense of doing so - and if that\\'s the case just give me my deposit back and I\\'ll go elsewhere.\\n@VerizonSupport On the termination box in my basement - there is a “replace battery” lite on and it’s beeping @VerizonSupport\\n@VerizonSupport Shame nothing ever was resolved. Maybe I should\\'ve stuck with @115955 🤔\\n@VerizonSupport Nope everything is running fine but the internet slows down specially when I’m live streaming when I got food everything was good until now\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I already tested on my phone and iPad\\n@VerizonSupport I used to get 80 down 50 up\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s been a week at least.

Keep up the amazing work.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank u !!....because I\\'m still waiting on the phone 😡. It would be NYC\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Oh! Thank you! Hey, while I\\'m tweeting to you, what\\'s the fastest connection you offer in fiber in CT?\\n@VerizonSupport Guess I’ll just expect tomorrow .... time to start looking around\\n@VerizonSupport I did that after last week and no change.

Also how to I get my series info back on my DVR ?\\n@VerizonSupport All I see is export\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, a few days back\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and I believe I clicked yes. I didn\\'t need to update anything else\\n@VerizonSupport Correct, and no series in my manage series menu\\n@VerizonSupport Says it’s currently unavailable. But customer service says we don’t get that channel evn though it says we do in the lineup.\\n@VerizonSupport No connection at all is there an outage in my area\\n@VerizonSupport Cell. We were upgrading one of our lines.\\n@VerizonSupport I was told I would hear from a regional or higher that over saw a local store location since the store treated my family in rude and racist\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry for the late reply. At the time, it was blinking red and we were without any internet. Came back an hour later. Thx for the help :-)\\n@VerizonSupport Na man Verizon is cool. It is from a YouTube vid\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the fast response, fortunately my internet has come back after 30 min. The globe light was out. Thanks again 😁\\n@VerizonSupport Fios.

It powers up but nothing\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, but it\\'s not connecting to any devices.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I did that when the issue first came up, I\\'m calling Infinity.

I\\'m done trying to get someone via the secure chat. @115722 is really making me reconsider their services 😒\\n@VerizonSupport Idk probably y\\'all trying to annoy me until I agree to upgrade\\n@VerizonSupport My order with 2nd cable box (MA00346781099) was supposed to be delivered yesterday, but UPS says due to error it is being returned to sender\\n@VerizonSupport Ever since my carrier update, my service is worse or nonexistent in places it used to work\\n@VerizonSupport The fact that I called your customer service and was transferred to a store where the employee was rude 😌 and didn’t help me\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport Your service is an embarrassment. If you weren\\'t an oligarch player you may actually need to answer to your customers..\\n@VerizonSupport That was tried multiple times. You had a technician here who failed.\\n@VerizonSupport No. Still slow and they billed me for not fixing the problem.\\n@VerizonSupport The ONT port is now slow due to your switching over traffic to provide gigabit speed to new customers.\\n@VerizonSupport They replaced the ONT port, but same spd still. Bound/Unbounded traffic was changed recently-ONT no longer as fast.\\n@VerizonSupport 85 is the hardwired spd from the ONT. Verizon never sent a router that I paid for initially. No diff-till now.\\n@VerizonSupport Multiple computers were plugged directly into ONT. The technician confirmed the spd is 85 not 150 anymore too.\\n@VerizonSupport VADQ0NX1XJ\\n@VerizonSupport Yep. I believe we have 75/75.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m always wired in, but my internet goes down at random times and I have to pause what I\\'m watching for 10 minutes then it\\'s back up.\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile clearly\\n@VerizonSupport Can we communicate via DM?\\n@VerizonSupport Can you give daily updates on the negotiation status?\\n@VerizonSupport Being billed for service I did not use.\\n@VerizonSupport Who knows.... VZ told me the previous was the final bill when I originally called in.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s internet. Billing cycle ended on Aug 22. \"Official\" cancellation date on the 23rd (which is a VZ mistake) so I\\'m billed in full.\\n@VerizonSupport This was equally as unhelpful as phone support.\\n@VerizonSupport Plus DVR and starz included\\n@VerizonSupport Well then I may be contacting you guys soon if I can get constant internet speeds that stay the same all day.\\n@VerizonSupport We have Fios\\n@VerizonSupport Yes😑 and it worked but i ran a test earlier and i had 4mb upload speed ( i think the modem is going bad i am looking into getting an old\\n@VerizonSupport Enterprise modem with  docsis3.1compatibly so i can download PfSense and avoid the issues i am having now by using a software not a firmware\\n@VerizonSupport You need to follow me back so we can dm\\n@VerizonSupport I sent verizon a dm and yall havn’t said shit 😂\\n@VerizonSupport link is not helpful, only thing agent can do is say i apologize 100x and so solution for the outage currently experiencing since 10/25/17\\n@VerizonSupport I only have the internet service. It doesn’t work https://t.co/ATwSbiiSOL\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I have. But that doesn’t work. The light is still red.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes!\\n@VerizonSupport Then, after 5 -10 minutes the popup does not come up anymore, and the Email works normal.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.

It started yesterday, b. worked well.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport It’s off still nothing\\n@VerizonSupport Not that I know of\\n@VerizonSupport Ok I’ll try\\n@VerizonSupport What else can I do?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport No?

Keep it up. 👍\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/iVUj5uHRsr\\n@VerizonSupport If I\\'m going to questioned if I can follow instructions then, find me someone else less insulting!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, not in use. Don\\'t have the phone service.\\n@VerizonSupport No battery in there\\n@VerizonSupport So, about the battery?! NOW WHAT?!\\n@VerizonSupport Wow, so frustrating! I took out one of the outgoing Ethernet Connections to plus my laptop in and show how shitty the signal and service is!\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/21TP5V3xYM\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/Xo3mUKtnNA\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.

Serious Question\\n@VerizonSupport No. I’m experiencing really slow speeds and it’s really frustrating\\n@VerizonSupport I usually always get 100 and up but it’s less than that. It’s on 7.4\\n@VerizonSupport It’s happening wired not just wireless\\n@VerizonSupport This link leads me to a FAQ page but no current info. Got information on phone from CS. Thanks anyway.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, signed in. When I sign in, it just redirects me to main page. Small Business Customer. No worries, I got the update from other sources.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m looking to upgrade to the IPhone X from my Galaxy S7 edge, but I\\'m not going to discuss specifics about my bill on Twitter.\\n@VerizonSupport How do I do that?\\n@VerizonSupport So I guess it\\'s working now\\n@VerizonSupport Download 0.96 mbps\\n@VerizonSupport I did connect and it\\'s very slow\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and they\\'re green.

Lady on the phone was very unhelpful.\\n@VerizonSupport I keep getting an error message after typing in the account number\\n@VerizonSupport No. I\\'m just going to try doing it over the phone with the automated system.\\n@VerizonSupport Residential issue is refusal to help my elderly mother over the phone or in store. She does not do well online and no one would help.\\n@VerizonSupport Last couple of days speed was slow. Worse than dial up. Today all fios customers in our ngbhood are having no/slow connectivity. Zip: 01886\\n@VerizonSupport Since this morning no Internet at all.\\n@VerizonSupport No. Didn\\'t call in yet!\\n@VerizonSupport No. Both are white.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.

Internet is still not restored was told it would be\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport That was no help\\n@VerizonSupport Nope\\n@VerizonSupport Support had given me a free data boost since I had an issue and now I’m being told nope you have to pay for it now to bad :(\\n@VerizonSupport My number is not supported to make a call.\\n@VerizonSupport Your Business Digital Voice people cancelled an installation without telling me. So I sat here for 3 hours waiting for no one.\\n@VerizonSupport I am now being passed around to customer service people, and one is supposed to call me back with some answers. So, not yet.\\n@VerizonSupport You did not. Your technician claimed he called me to confirm this morning, but he DID NOT. So we have poor customer service AND lying here.\\n@VerizonSupport Her # is 718-375-6082\\n@VerizonSupport Through Dish...but I live on the border of 2 towns. My service is thru a town with fios tv my zip is in a town that doesn\\'t.\\n@VerizonSupport The streaming feed seems to be working ok now but the initial loading is still slow\\n@VerizonSupport Idk the box outside the house broke some how????? but no one can come until tomorrow to fix it\\n@VerizonSupport I mean I would hope so. Still ruins my entire weekend\\n@VerizonSupport Can you let me know when so people don’t loose service\\n@VerizonSupport Hi I got the reference number they said to use 76751\\n@VerizonSupport Geg did not given me a ticket number they said I take your info and put it in for someone to look at\\n@VerizonSupport Ok we made a report can you check and see if anything came in the system\\n@VerizonSupport What is the link can you send out a tech\\n@VerizonSupport Are they going to send out a tech or not\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/DsFFyOZCQD\\n@VerizonSupport As noted.

I\\'d still like to log into my account though\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve only tried the last two weeks and it\\'s been like this ever since\\n@VerizonSupport Not that because same issue at home and at work. Issue is with code on your webpage\\n@VerizonSupport When logged in. This page refreshes constantly. Can\\'t do anything. https://t.co/caLbTtVOeG\\n@VerizonSupport Residential internet. I\\'ve tried multiple browsers on multiple computers. All do the same. I log in and the page just loops.\\n@VerizonSupport No......\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the quick response! It’s for wireless mobile.\\n@VerizonSupport ... the coupons and the points used to acquire them appear to be gone forever. Can you help us reclaim them, please?\\n@VerizonSupport Boxes back with the tec because i needed an internet only plan. I was told i would get new customer pricing and then they could not do that\\n@VerizonSupport I clicked the link signed in nothing shows up what’s next\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. It looks like there’s a general (“All FioS services are down”) outage, but we can’t get a timeline on what’s being done about it.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the reply, but I figured that out already. Didn\\'t think it was your issue, anyways, hence you not being tagged...\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t know where the battery backup is and we have cell phones with Verizon as well.\\n@VerizonSupport this has been done many times over by other people on @116655 twitter with the same issue as me, im just wondering why this happens,  because it isn\\'t the first time verizon users in the east coast can\\'t connect to blizz servers\\n@VerizonSupport WOW @VerizonSupport SO HELPFUL #THANKS..... NOT\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you!!\\n@VerizonSupport It’s about Fios bill(it went up ~$50 w/ no notice &amp; I didn’t buy anything) I called that # and it keeps taking me to wireless or disconnects\\n@VerizonSupport NJ. Not sure on contract. I had no notifications about it ending.\\n@VerizonSupport Looks like the bundle changed (but I never authorized or requested this)\\n@VerizonSupport Phone and internet .... neither are working !!\\n@VerizonSupport I think fios , it\\'s now been over a week  , customer service said someone would contact me and still nothing . Disappointing\\n@VerizonSupport Put FiOS in Monroe NJ.. I beg you!!!😭😭😭😭\\n@VerizonSupport It did and it\\'s not available I was just wondering if you would know what time frame maybe\\n@VerizonSupport I did.  There aren’t\\n@VerizonSupport I know how to read my bill. It\\'s listed as a one-time activity. No credit. Complete fraud. I wonder how many customers Verizon did this to?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ll call next week and take care of it. I want an explanation and I want to make sure the same thing is not happening to other customers.\\n@VerizonSupport Just annoying to ask a bill question and get lots of irrelevant search results. And to not get real replies. Maybe don’t call it support?\\n@VerizonSupport Hell no.  I tried talking to your reps via phone and they hung up on me. HELL NO.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Didn\\'t work.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, again, I\\'ve done all of these steps explained through the Support module. I cannot get anyone on the phone or chat. Twitter last resort\\n@VerizonSupport My STB is no longer transmitting a signal to the TV. HDMI cable, coax all check out. HDMI port on TV is fine\\n@VerizonSupport To which I must say, who the fuck is buying wifi to connect to Ethernet ports, which spoiler alert, aren\\'t even on most laptops these days\\n@VerizonSupport So, your false advertising that speed then?\\n@VerizonSupport Do you want me to broadcast this on twitter or would you prefer to message me direct\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m using a set top box.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Are you seeing it on your box?\\n@VerizonSupport Nope.  The guide says tmz now, and empire at 8.\\n\\nIt\\'s broadcasting correctly, but not listed in the guide.\\n@VerizonSupport It fixed itself.

Same in Herndon and Springfield...\\n@VerizonSupport Ok\\n.will check tomorrow after game\\n@VerizonSupport Do you refer to them as \"real humans\" because you are secretly run by lizardman overlords?\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s exactly what a lizardman overlord would say.\\n@VerizonSupport Come get me you scaley monsters! I have a bunker stocked with enough ammo and booze to last a dozen nuclear winters!\\n@VerizonSupport @161510 Too lazy to use a real human on your twitter?\\n@VerizonSupport What billing issue? Already following\\n@VerizonSupport It was during my the Flyers and Blackhawks. It was condensed, not full screen. I guess I was the only one.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. It’s back to normal but from 8-1030pm it was standard. I guess it was my box only. Thanks anyway.\\n@VerizonSupport Just one I believe.\\n@VerizonSupport Home\\n@VerizonSupport Been having issues with my service for the past 3 to 6 months, literally I had about 3 maybe 4 technicians come out to my house\\n@VerizonSupport I hope you\\'re not just saying this... i been on the line since 7pm... i was transfered 6 times!! I\\'m irritated at the fact, that cust svc\\n@VerizonSupport DM has been sent... i hope I\\'m not wasting my time\\n@VerizonSupport No, and I\\'ve received emails that ask for it now, but it\\'s hard to tell what is requested when nothing says \"router\" just serial numbers\\n@VerizonSupport That depends entirely on the management and if the router wasn\\'t lost during cleaning. I\\'m going to ask, just want this done.\\n@VerizonSupport You can check if the router has been logged into the system or otherwise noted as returned?\\n@VerizonSupport Followed and DM\\'ed, thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport I only have one tv, so yeah\\n@VerizonSupport It’s avail in my building. Trying to determine what actual network speed will be. Know cost is around half of Spectrum.\\n@VerizonSupport Link says up to 940 down and 840 up. So is that 5 Mbps ? 25 ? 940 ?  I’m looking for actual line speed not theoretical speed.\\n@VerizonSupport I have. After I was prompted by my iPhone. I can only login through the https://t.co/kt3o5afmEq portal but not yahoo or iphone mail\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon is my provider? I can login through https://t.co/ObtDYgit1C and then chose check email but not https://t.co/uiiwW668UM\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m not sure which portal had me reset the password so I\\'m not sure but my original password stop working so I was forced to reset it\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/Fl3aRv3OiY, i can sign into https://t.co/ObtDYgit1C just fine but that\\'s my only way of accessing it.\\n@VerizonSupport @119033 Okay I will try that and come back if the problem persists. Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport iPhone.\\n@VerizonSupport My guess based looking at hashtags it’s not just Fios. NBC has new listed but repeats.

I suspect someone was supposed to get a tweet\\n@VerizonSupport The instructions on the router for rebooting are to press and hold down on the WPS button for 10 seconds. Is there any other step involved?\\n@VerizonSupport Lol this is shit\\n@VerizonSupport Maybe it’s a general message. “Got a billing issue? We’ll investigate it!”\\nInvestigations for you, investigations for everybody!!\\n@VerizonSupport @450224 To bad you don\\'t offer that to current customers in appreciation of their loyalty\\n@VerizonSupport We were told we would have TV back at 5pm. Is there an update for the #woodsideouttage\\n@VerizonSupport No I can’t see in the link what time. Can I please have an update?\\n@VerizonSupport I got it figured out. Had to clear catche and data and got it working. Thanks for the quick response though.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s not my boxes, it\\'s the signal you are or should say aren\\'t sending.

I just wasted my time! 😡\\n@VerizonSupport Ha - that’s who disconnected the call.

I understand you personally arent at fault but your company is...\\n@VerizonSupport the planet is red but the WiFi is red, i did the whole reset thing already\\n@VerizonSupport Ok thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.

Nothing can be done?\\n@VerizonSupport Can I ask how to do it ?\\n@VerizonSupport Ok I\\'ve done it but it\\'s still the same. Like the connection just stops and it has to reconnect. All this is happening while hard wired 1/2\\n@VerizonSupport I haven\\'t monitored it\\n@VerizonSupport yes it happens once about every 5 minutes\\n@VerizonSupport There\\'s only one thing hardwired to it and already did that.\\n@VerizonSupport Balance from account incorrectly closed\\n@VerizonSupport I was told they were crediting the cancelation fees after receiving the bill.

Feel as though we should be offered gigabit at a\\n@VerizonSupport This is even with \"deals\" on the account. I\\'ve also talked up FiOS to friends and family - but now I\\'m becoming more hesitant to suggest you\\n@VerizonSupport jumping ship. We\\'ve been considering cord cutting for a while now. Bill is approaching $200 which is unacceptable to retain loyal customers.\\n@VerizonSupport The bill is way too high. Considering that you\\'re offering new customers base rates for gigabit triple play of $79.99 we are considering\\n@VerizonSupport Have been with FiOS since almost the day it was available in our neighborhood.

Do you need the router for internet?\\n@VerizonSupport Just now.  Same thing\\n@VerizonSupport just now, same thing\\n@VerizonSupport See that little upside-down triangle at the top left of my screen shot?  That means I\\'m connected to my Wifi.  In fact, it is my FIOS wifi.  If I wasn\\'t connected to wifi, you would see \"LTE\" there instead.\\n@VerizonSupport It was the WiFi Assist under the \"Cellular\" menu on iPhone.  You have to turn that off.  That was the trick.\\n@VerizonSupport No wired devices, everything is connected through wifi\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s the problem my 5GHZ doesn\\'t show up anymore to connect to.\\n@VerizonSupport In the next room away from router on 2.4GHZ... https://t.co/aOi1VMQwXa\\n@VerizonSupport I was able to connect at first to it. I reset it so I\\'m gonna see what happens. But no personal settings\\n@VerizonSupport The 5GHZ popped up after resetting... Next room away from router. Hopefully this works better.

Ipad, cell phones, and laptops.\\n@VerizonSupport The router is in my living room which is towards the back of the house. At times it doesn\\'t work when I\\'m in the basement which is right..\\n@VerizonSupport I took one out of another room one it’s fine. Put the bad one in that room and it still doesn’t work.\\n@VerizonSupport I’d rather pick one up. Don’t want to be without it. I know there is an office in Middleboro ma.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok. Can I get a ticket. Still 46 minutes and no one answering the phone.\\n@VerizonSupport Can you check to see if I did it right?  Haven’t dm before\\n@VerizonSupport I really hope they bring everything necessary to fix it, include a new device if it is the reason of my Internet is off.\\n@VerizonSupport I feel like this needs to be reported to the fcc. I feel violated. I gave my zip code and address that should be enough\\n@VerizonSupport Its not right to do that. Frankly its gotta be illegal. Then he was beyond pushy trying to get me to book installation.\\n@VerizonSupport Our contract will expire in around 4 months and I understand you are trying to entice NEW customers. But you\\'re going to lose EXISTING ones.\\n@VerizonSupport What also gets me is how quickly the \"base price\" is inflated by equipment rentals. I understand it - but all the more reason to lower bills\\n@VerizonSupport disproportional. Yes we had promos when we signed up many years ago - but the internet plans were tightly clustered. Gig internet is ++++\\n@VerizonSupport That is wireless, my MacBook doesn\\'t have an ethernet port. Either way it shouldn\\'t be THAT slow even if its not 75/75\\n@VerizonSupport No, same place it has been working perfectly for the past year, nothing has changed but the (lack of) speed\\n@VerizonSupport You\\'re forced to remove that channel because of a dispute\\n@VerizonSupport No, there\\'s a message that plays saying the channel is not available because of a dispute\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.

We\\'re supposed to get 100/100, but speed tests have been super low and streaming on 1 device buffers constantly.\\n@VerizonSupport Websites, even twitter, are taking forever to load as well.

So i couldn\\'t find the Wi-Fi analyzer.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless.  This is an every day thing.  Sometimes it dips into kbs.\\n@VerizonSupport We\\'ve done this before, never yields any results, I\\'m tired of paying for terrible service, and robot responses.\\n@VerizonSupport Doesn\\'t matter, either way, speeds are trash.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes 90277\\n@VerizonSupport You do a little research you won\\'t have to ask these questions.

My FiOS family love ❤️ ^BCW\\n@VerizonSupport It was not explained that I would be losing 19.99/month.  Who in their right mind would agree to that?  I did not add new features.\\n@VerizonSupport No a perpetual 19.99 discount that was eliminated when I renewed but my new price quote was only $5 more  No mention of loss of discount\\n@VerizonSupport tried that and all systems go. #100devices more like 1-ish. #fiosgigabit https://t.co/ZeVSrgsHpt\\n@VerizonSupport also “Our speed test is set to work with the technology” is proof the speeds r bullshit vs more independent tests\\n@VerizonSupport Says is unavailable and to try changing channel\\n@VerizonSupport Still wrong.

THAT would help!\\n@VerizonSupport I have the iPhone 7+ that I updated to last year in December, what would the cost be to update to the 8? Or the X?\\n@VerizonSupport took care of a balance-\"overdue\" because VERIZON made an error- told just days ago I have a 0 balance, wake up to CBR collection item notice\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless.

I\\'ve got my plan in writing so I better not get another $700 bill the next day.\\n@VerizonSupport I have 150/150 &amp; normally have zero issues. Is this an outage on the east coast? Eric is having issues, as well as other East Coasters\\n@VerizonSupport I dont see a red light.\\n@VerizonSupport Here are all things we tried https://t.co/FUBNiSqTZO\\n@VerizonSupport First msg is set top box is offline but troubleshoot says there is no issue but the interactive svc is unavail.

I\\'ll go through that now and see what I get.\\n@VerizonSupport y\\'all took 30 mins. Phone call back from support took 3 hrs.  Y\\'all win, although problem won\\'t be fixed without a home visit apparently. TY\\n@VerizonSupport I’m about to follow “Can you hear me now” right over to sprint.\\n@VerizonSupport no it’s not in my car. Been with Verizon for 14 years never had problems now things are horrible.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Checked. All is fine\\n@VerizonSupport Not really. Questions beyond that.

Can’t even watch tv on it\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s correct.\\n@VerizonSupport Desktop I\\'ve tried Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, plus private browsing modes. Just Chrome on the phone. Doesn\\'t seem like a browser issue.\\n@VerizonSupport I believe so. It\\'s aaa,.com\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. Typed directly.\\n@VerizonSupport Well that\\'s all great.

It’s the only one I️ have.\\n@VerizonSupport What is the battery backup unit?\\n@VerizonSupport And how do I️ reboot?\\n@VerizonSupport Took me 40 minutes of waiting, but finally got someone on the line. Why are wait times so bad?\\n@VerizonSupport We were able to solve it by rebuilding cross-connect. Tech was very helpful. Waiting an hour after being told it\\'s a 2-4 min wait, wasn\\'t.\\n@VerizonSupport We’re watching one show but not recording anything. When I press DVR it shows my recordings but not anything being recorded.\\n@VerizonSupport Nothing was supposed to be taped at that time and nothing was being taped but the light on the STB was lit.\\n@VerizonSupport No. Just a white light next to REC\\n@VerizonSupport No. I’ll try it. I just saw it lit and thought “what am I taping?” When I looked, I wasn’t taping anything.\\n@VerizonSupport Now I’m recording 60 Minutes.

Existing subscribers subsidize those low offers, so as to avoid true price competition.\\n@VerizonSupport Don\\'t worry. I\\'m sure we\\'ll be in touch soon.

I\\'m sure my neighbors are also dissatisfied.\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/7sQUY9ZfOi\\n@VerizonSupport Per my last chat with the rep abt a month ago, she said that I shud see a credit for the service restoral\\n@VerizonSupport Max @ those but usually much slower\\nWe pay for faster\\nNorm\\nDown = 1.6-2 Mb\\nUp = 300-500 Kb\\nVerizon fiber is nearby but told we can\\'t connect\\n@VerizonSupport I KEEP GETTING KICKED OFFLINE, I CAN’T PLAY @119514 IN PEACE\\n@VerizonSupport I’m wireless, lights do change, and other devices lose connection\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and it’s constantly\\n@VerizonSupport No it’s just the router\\n@VerizonSupport @505341 SAME\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m getting 37mb download and 50 upload.

We’re new customers, so we’re not sure how things work.\\n@VerizonSupport Hello, new support. No, the router is behind a big honkin tv that makes it highly difficult to plug directly into\\n^CL\\n@VerizonSupport See if use the Verizon app it’ll say it’s the correct speed because it’s doing it with you servers. So I’m not gonna do that.\\n@VerizonSupport A possible solution to the phone issues. A new replacement for the third replacement phone. I don\\'t find that a good solution\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport doesn\\'t seem to be an issue with anyone except me. I reset the router a few times now, what\\'s the next step?\\n@VerizonSupport No just WiFi\\n@VerizonSupport This is where my equipment is located. Is there anyway we could have it rewired to possibly our living room some how? https://t.co/1s6GbU3JM7\\n@VerizonSupport Unfortunately it wouldn’t reach and would be inconvenient. My router is in like a shoe closet. My PlayStation is in my room to the left of the closet. My bfs xbox in the living room on the other side of a furnace. Would that cause interference?\\n@VerizonSupport What is that? &amp; how do I do that?\\n@VerizonSupport @520953 I\\'m going to have to call next week. I\\'m using a wired connection and getting 7/4 on a 50/50 plan &gt;:(\\n@VerizonSupport on my wireless device that can run your tester: 16down/18up which agrees with an independent tester. My wired device that must run it\\'s own test gets 44down/4up. Even at 18, the up is a serious problem.

Though I\\'ve had your service for over 7yrs\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m wanting to switch to internet only, but you\\'re going to charge $59.99 rather than $39.99 for new customer. 2 year customer means nothing\\n@VerizonSupport Ok we\\'ll be cancelling our service with you completely then\\n@VerizonSupport I called this number and they kicked me over to Frontier Communications. I spoke with Frontier, but this is not their account.\\n@VerizonSupport Okay great, thanks so much.\\n@VerizonSupport Seems like it\\'s impossible to downgrade through the website?\\n@VerizonSupport \"The Guide is not working.

We are now being told they are scared to activate it because we said we didn’t want to be double charged.\\n@VerizonSupport Here we are. Still no league pass. Verizon reps still lying to us\\n@VerizonSupport Got double charged, then called about it and was told the charge would be removed, but instead they took away my subscription to NBALP\\n@VerizonSupport No router looks good\\n@VerizonSupport Pressed the reset button on the black backup battery and it\\'s been almost 10 minutes and it\\'s still not working.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. I believe so.\\n@VerizonSupport No custom settings..   everything was working and just stopped working out of no where\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s red.\\n@VerizonSupport I only have internet and it\\'s been down since 3pm.\\n@VerizonSupport According to the site,  everything is good.\\n@VerizonSupport ok\\n@VerizonSupport i know that but the guide info for Fox is missing the Univision stuff is right but the information for fox is not showing\\n@VerizonSupport yes it is is says removed on app also won\\'t play its fox 5 dc sd and hd  channels\\n@VerizonSupport yes even the show I recorded on that channel won\\'t play\\n@VerizonSupport nothing its still says channel removed its from the Univision thing\\n@VerizonSupport My experience is when recording several consecutive episodes from the guide, The start of episode 4 will be at the end of 3\\'s recording\\n@VerizonSupport This computer has Windows Vista 64 bit\\n@VerizonSupport Did support for Vista disappear over the weekend? I can get to the Verizon Wireless page - and the Verizon Business page. https://t.co/ctPudDnkoC\\n@VerizonSupport Can we take this to Twitter\\'s Direct Messaging?

Idk his security question answers &amp; it keeps forgetting my computer. I want to know why this error keeps happening.\\n@VerizonSupport Don\\'t guess at the reasons.

Are we talking hours or days?\\n@VerizonSupport NYHM02JWDL\\n@VerizonSupport yes\\n@VerizonSupport I thought you did? https://t.co/CnqVxglqhY and https://t.co/tBcT4AYbCo\\n@VerizonSupport Totally understand that piece - this issue actually happened previously when I had my VZ router only. I\\'m based in Peekskill, NY.\\n@VerizonSupport WRT 3200 ACM by Linksys\\n@VerizonSupport Back to original wifi situation - Now 9.87 down , 11.85 up . This is all over the place and not consistent service?\\n@VerizonSupport Wired: 98.15 down / 71.56 up . Might be wifi broadcasting? Using WRT 3200 ACM router .\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the response! It\\'s via wifi - tested in different areas of the house and speeds vary dramatically. Quickest I\\'ve got is 34 down\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry, I wasn’t clear. I was trying to cancel extra services &amp; add others. It was 2 difficult to get an answer so I just cancelled extras\\n@VerizonSupport The support person was utterly unprepared to answer simple questions. It was clearly a training issue. I just cancelled what I could.\\n@VerizonSupport yes I used the B button and got no results found...I usually work nights so I didn\\'t realize that channel was not there\\n@VerizonSupport I appreciate that but not if it is going to cost more $$\\n@VerizonSupport OK I just did so thank you for your prompt response - I am a huge Devils fan and I love watching the games on MSG on FIOS\\n@VerizonSupport MSG Plus 2 is not available in HD.\\n@VerizonSupport I understand that and that’s nice but my ticket was supposed to be resolved the tech never showed up that’s not my problem that’s yours\\n@VerizonSupport Are we even getting any type of reimbursement for this inconvenience it\\'s cause my family?!!\\n@VerizonSupport What if it still shows?\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t see an ONT reset button on the BBU https://t.co/fKm7ZoiW1C\\n@VerizonSupport Okay! That solved it! Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I think it’s next to the router\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Although not both white as what should be happening. https://t.co/3ltSjqYsC7\\n@VerizonSupport Nope.

Been waiting for almost an hour for @115722 to fix my bill. Internet only.\\n@VerizonSupport yeah. not happy with this on top of existing billing problem. @comcastcares\\n@VerizonSupport The MyFios app. On phone &amp; tablet - same problem. Won\\'t load. Ever\\n@VerizonSupport No. I don\\'t really have a lot of time right now. But why would that help, since it isfailing on both my iPhone and my iPad???\\n@VerizonSupport Oddly, it worked. It\\'s just puzzling that it failed in the same way on both devices, &amp; the website is wonky (as usual). Thanks...\\n@VerizonSupport I am looking to add my wife’s name.\\n@VerizonSupport they can\\'t identify the acccount.\\n@VerizonSupport yes bc we only have 1 box; syfy channel, smithsonian, &amp; sometimes movies we purchase\\n@VerizonSupport will try this tonite\\n@VerizonSupport That doesn’t answer my question.

He then stated he’d sign us up. Even though their were other minor issues, I was happy with my purchase. As of two days ago, I received\\n@VerizonSupport Much appreciated\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, light is red.  Have fios, quantum router, tried resetting.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.  Rented the movie an hour and a half ago, and have only actually made it through 55 mins of actual movie time\\n@VerizonSupport That reduced it a bit, but not completely\\n@VerizonSupport The link you sent doesn’t load\\n@VerizonSupport Found program with much frustration, never had these problems with @115900 or @196577 maybe study their product.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Can you please do that? They asked if it was pre or postapaid, and when I answered pre, they wouldn\\'t even give me the courtesy of a reply.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I need to extent ptp\\n@VerizonSupport My family has FiOS and phone bills for YEARS and they can’t offer any discounts and clearly don’t value people staying with Verizon.\\n@VerizonSupport REO told me one discount and then tried to change the discount to something else HORRIBLE SEVICE\\n@VerizonSupport I AM MOVING INTO A NEW PLACE SO THIS WOULD BE A NEW ACCOUNT. THE SERVICE I AM RECIVING IS HORRIBLE GOING TO TELL EVERYONE I KNOW.\\n@VerizonSupport Just trying trade in a brand new phone for a new one and pay more money.

On all devices at the same time.\\n@VerizonSupport @115722 For my speeds update\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport @115722 The 24 hours have pass\\n@VerizonSupport We do this everytime this happens.\\n@VerizonSupport We just unplugged the STB and waiting for it to power up. The coax cable is not loose on either.\\n@VerizonSupport The image is better but there is still static in the picture https://t.co/ngD0B4jmrn\\n@VerizonSupport Yep, that worked, thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport A house\\n@VerizonSupport Im familiar with the battery box i dont have one.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Ok thats done.\\n@VerizonSupport Your setup box is having difficulty connecting to server\\n@VerizonSupport Same thing\\n@VerizonSupport No i do not have one.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes checked all wires and unplugged and plugged back in\\n@VerizonSupport Your set top box is having difficulty connecting to server\\n@VerizonSupport Tv isn\\'t working at all hasn\\'t for 3 days.The Wi-Fi is horrible can\\'t even stream in room 10 ft away with out tons of lag.\\n@VerizonSupport What should I do if I find it\\n@VerizonSupport The system status is the only thing lit\\n@VerizonSupport I held the button down for 15 seconds it reset but this is all the happened https://t.co/F9RlDqUUmf\\n@VerizonSupport Its been about 5 minutes and nothing has changed is there something else I can do?\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s black box plugged into a wall in the basement and the router is upstairs. For the battery, the green light goes off\\n@VerizonSupport This is the router. There are four for LAN. https://t.co/Ppskvbsnwu\\n@VerizonSupport Our Internet was slow so we unplugged and re-plugged in. And now nothing. On hold for 40 minutes with advanced tech support\\n@VerizonSupport Idk. I’m connected to WiFi at my workplace. But I’m wondering why I have no service. Not why my WiFi is limited\\n@VerizonSupport Ohh gotcha. Well I can’t check the router here. I’ll ask again if I get home and have the same problem\\n@VerizonSupport I’m now home and still have no service. It’s been over 4 hours. I deliver for a delivery app and can’t right now due to this. Please help.\\n@VerizonSupport All green\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve had no service for 4 consecutive hours. Started at work. Then walked home. Now I’m home. Still no service. Would the router affect that\\n@VerizonSupport OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'VE ALREADY DONE THAT MULTIPLE TIMES\\n@VerizonSupport No. Can I do it through 192.168.1.1?\\n@VerizonSupport It says it should be enabled but its not! Why is there always an issue with Verizon\\n@VerizonSupport Yes but it either says something like \"unable to join\" or \"incorrect password\"\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Can we escalate this to a live chat or something? Its getting late.\\n@VerizonSupport No.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah... I think thats why I\\'d be tweeting about it...\\n@VerizonSupport Apparently it requires Verizon to \"send a command\" to my router.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, like I just said, my 5ghz internet keeps disabling itself.\\n@VerizonSupport I do. I also rebooted.  Still no service triple play is down.\\n@VerizonSupport Still out.\\n@VerizonSupport Any other tips?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m sure I can.  What are you driving at?\\n@VerizonSupport U want me to remove it and replace it after a minute?\\n@VerizonSupport After battery pull waited for 3 minutes and reinstalled.  Serv still completely out.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport They are free. However, episodes 2 &amp; 3 are simply missing.  Explain please?\\nThis is bad customer service, or terrible deal making. Or both\\n@VerizonSupport WiFi at my house. It’s just certain channels. Very strange.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok well I’m literally sitting next to my router.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Restarted device. Even while playing a game and streaming via the Fios app, I’m at 21 mbps down and 17 mbps up.\\n@VerizonSupport Playing Pc game, using iPad to (try to) stream tv, tested speed on iPhone\\n@VerizonSupport About 50-60 mbps at PC. I don’t think it’s a connectivity problem with the internet. I think it’s a problem with the app and/or that channel\\n@VerizonSupport Fox wttg #517\\n@VerizonSupport That does not make sense to me unless you are saying direct tv gets signal out faster than Verizon\\n@VerizonSupport I am in Baltimore area, friend in Charlottesville area. I did not rewind anything. Just switched channel to the game in 6th inning\\n@VerizonSupport Hmm https://t.co/8lRkYT0g4o from my phone, outside my office shoes 420mbps. \\n\\nI suspect you’re right about the interference.\\n@VerizonSupport ok. Well if you’re not detecting any issues with my connection (despite there definitely being issues), there’s not much I can do, is there?\\n@VerizonSupport And I’m tech savvy enough to say if you don’t think there’s an issue, fine. I can fix it myself. Which is what I will do.\\n@VerizonSupport Perhaps to offer better service, your server should provide a more accurate number, instead of the optimal one.\\n@VerizonSupport I suspect that is the cases for most households.\\n@VerizonSupport Over the last few days, it has felt a lot more like what https://t.co/B6YafyeAC7 says I have.\\n@VerizonSupport So you say there is no outage but verizon suppport says there is?\\n@VerizonSupport @31806 and you’re trying to charge me per episode of the current season 5. That’s ludicrous!\\n@VerizonSupport I did. I went through all the steps that the box told me. 3 times.\\n@VerizonSupport yes. channel either unavailable, frozen, or distorted. have rebooted the box multiple times now\\n@VerizonSupport Do a say what now lol?\\n@VerizonSupport I have to do that at least once a week.\\n@VerizonSupport I can get to it\\n@VerizonSupport What do I need to do with the back up unit?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. The problem is on multiple devices. The internet light on the modem is orange\\n@VerizonSupport yes.  The \"internet\" light is red\\n@VerizonSupport maryland\\n@VerizonSupport yes\\n@VerizonSupport no outage is on internet on fios, but can\\'t check on desktop b/c no internet\\n@VerizonSupport Yes they are\\n@VerizonSupport Neither, I’m using wireless data.\\n@VerizonSupport My tv and phone don’t work. Neighbors do\\n@VerizonSupport Replace battery which u sent me less than 1 year ago\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport All the lights are gone so I can’t do it\\n@VerizonSupport No red or green\\n@VerizonSupport That reset it and it works now\\n@VerizonSupport No internet too\\n@VerizonSupport Only green but it keeps shutting down until I press the bottom button and reset it\\n@VerizonSupport Battery emergency use. Nothing happens when I press alarm silence\\n@VerizonSupport The outlet works and the small power supply box has a little green light on it\\n@VerizonSupport Battery light on again. Tv was on for 30 seconds then shy down. Both green and red lights are on now\\n@VerizonSupport It was replace  battery. It shut off again all lights went out\\n@VerizonSupport Any more 💡 ideas\\n@VerizonSupport Nothing on the box is lit\\n@VerizonSupport Worked for 15 seconds and shut down again\\n@VerizonSupport I will but the out does work. I have a light plugged in that’s working\\n@VerizonSupport Ok\\n@VerizonSupport home account\\n@VerizonSupport i get this: https://t.co/agQVhAYRgi\\n@VerizonSupport i was not, i just assume it\\'s being worked on lol\\n@VerizonSupport no i do not, but i think it is getting fixed, there was a storm in my area. i have power just no internet, idk if that helps.\\n@VerizonSupport i believe so\\n@VerizonSupport The ONT is green on system status and the router is working fine. We aren\\'t getting a WAN IP and the TV signal goes black every 30-45 sec\\n@VerizonSupport Unfortunately it\\'s still down. We had heavy winds here in central NJ yesterday. Are there any know outages in Monmouth County?\\n@VerizonSupport I cannot login to our family account to check that. Is there another way to check outages?\\n@VerizonSupport Hi, I\\'m having connection issues with internet and TV. Can\\'t access account to check outages. Tried resetting everything here no luck\\n@VerizonSupport The wifi is on but my home network still not showing\\n@VerizonSupport Ok. So on the default name I can rename the network from my fios login?\\n@VerizonSupport “We are residential support.  This needs to go to the app developers.  We can’t help you.”\\n@VerizonSupport Circular hell - 800-VERIZON can,t help, forwards to app team - who emails and says tells us more in the app (that does not work).\\n@VerizonSupport I need a telephone call from Verizon support today.  Tonight, I will start documenting my frustrations via Twitter with #badcustomersupport\\n@VerizonSupport Kind of ironic, in that I am tweeting this from the device, and it is on the FiOS network. https://t.co/XF7aujGG5v\\n@VerizonSupport I get an error message when I try to report anything in the app.\\n@VerizonSupport FiOS mobile app cannot pair to a set top box. You can help by providing a technical support telephone number.\\n@VerizonSupport There doesn’t appear to be any button anywhere inside\\n@VerizonSupport System light blinking red\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/A49jnEX1ZQ\\n@VerizonSupport We unplugged and plugged it back in.\\n@VerizonSupport Train your staff so that every time I call with a simple question I don\\'t get rudeness, incompetence, and have to request a supervisor.\\n@VerizonSupport You have been negotiating for a month now and you are no where near getting a deal agreed upon. @117310 @115722 stop being petty.\\n@VerizonSupport There was this system issue upon installation so I was being overcharged for six months and an installation fee. It took eight phone calls for emails and a lot of aggravation to get someone that said they would credit and I’m not even sure it still correct.\\n@VerizonSupport You can cut the cute clever bullshit. You\\'re not Burger King. Maybe improve your customer service or in fact your service in general.\\n@VerizonSupport why haven\\'t you done anything the 7 times I\\'ve called with problems? Fixed nothing. My internet is trash &amp; I\\'m charged out the ass.\\n@VerizonSupport It cuts out, slows for no reason or doesn\\'t work at all. You\\'ve sent me 3 new routers in the last 8 months and nothing has changed.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. And a dozen times today (not me my assistant). Unable categorically to reach a person at that number.\\n@VerizonSupport And I’ve moved someplace where you don’t have stores.\\n@VerizonSupport Can you please DM me a phone number with a greater chance of actually contacting a human being?\\n@VerizonSupport I have a dozen times. No humans there.\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve moved, no fios at my new address, trying to close account and return equipment.\\n@VerizonSupport I was.  You punted the issue to someone who, for some unknown reason, I cannot talk directly to.  You refuse to tell me when it can be fixed\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon Fios for everyone by 2014 and when I switched from spectrum a year ago the sales associate assured me I was months away from it\\n@VerizonSupport Oh, that’s going to happen! And this damn bill is what’s going on! Y’all got me fucked up.\\n@VerizonSupport WIRELESS!!\\n@VerizonSupport Thinking I should call @CoxHelp instead.\\n@VerizonSupport I already am following you and the super super supervisor was supposed to call me a month ago to fix the problem with the reception and zero\\n@VerizonSupport Fail light is blinking\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve now been on hold for a total of 6 hours, missed three full days of work waiting for technicians to show up who never did\\n@VerizonSupport Yup and wired as well. Still not getting anywhere close... this has been going on for an entire month now.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve done it about a million times.\\n@VerizonSupport By not trying to scum me in the purchase of the iPhone 8 Everything is the opposite of what I was told. Poor customer service lowest quality\\n@VerizonSupport All TVs\\n@VerizonSupport Everything from connection issues to no internet is happening. My neighbors fios is doing the same thing. Yes I called. No, no one is telling us anything. Supposedly its getting worked out.\\n@VerizonSupport No I’m ok, Thank you for the response.\\n@VerizonSupport yes for starz and epix, I never wanted them nor have I ever watched them!!\\n@VerizonSupport We are now approaching 24hours without services. Services were supposed to be restored within 4hours after payment. Customer service rep says my situation is out of his hands🤷🏽\\u200d♀️ I don\\'t want to get petty. Just restore my services pls.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Services were cut. Payment was made immediately. Msg said to call 18669621946 followed by a code. Apparently Verizon is closed🤷🏽\\u200d♀️ since yesterday 🤷🏽\\u200d♀️\\n@VerizonSupport Residential\\n@VerizonSupport Been trying since yesterday! Apparently I must call during normal service hours 8am-6pm Monday-Friday🤷🏽\\u200d♀️\\n@VerizonSupport Something other than your \"Do Not Knock\" list? Added same address to it four times in the last two years. It doesn\\'t seem to work very well.\\n@VerizonSupport I believe so\\n@VerizonSupport so ur not giving out the league pass for free this year like last year on go90 app?\\n@VerizonSupport Have you considered I shouldn\\'t need to since I pay for what Verizon says is their best router and yea I did try that\\n@VerizonSupport Every time *\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. I responded to the prompt with my number and it sat there for half an hour. This is why I hate Verizon. It\\'s always like this.\\n@VerizonSupport Send the link again.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport Hey! No, I was using my online browser on my laptop for Google Chrome\\n@VerizonSupport Unfortunately, it’s my roommate’s account. It’s DSL. We can’t get FIOS.\\n@VerizonSupport No I meant Verizon is great!   10 HD channels for NBA League Pass and Comcast only had 1 or 2 ,  I\\'m very happy with Verizon fios!\\n@VerizonSupport The issue was on your residential site - where review your calls and voicemails. The intro page would reload when you\\'d click on anything\\n@VerizonSupport I have - I have tried chrome, IE and firefox, have cleared cookies and rebooted\\n@VerizonSupport Channel 509 says Chef at Home and it is Modern Family.

However,as w/DTV @117830 if endless commercials r inserted into my recordings w/FFW disabled,I will drop\\n@VerizonSupport That info doesn’t resolve the problem. I pay over $200+ a month and can’t even watch what I want. Time for a change I guess!!\\n@VerizonSupport Pay the Spanish company what it’s asking for. Same way you (Verizon) like to increase monthly bills on people, and claim you don’t. Otherwise your shit is going down! All Spanish ppl will be cutting you off!!!\\n@VerizonSupport It’s about my Fios bill... I tried online chat and they told me to call. Can someone PLEASE call me? Horrible, horrible customer service.\\n@VerizonSupport NY state 12603\\n@VerizonSupport All the channels I watch are gone that sucks\\n@VerizonSupport They can’t get to an agreement with Univision\\n@VerizonSupport hi, followed but can’t yet DM.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Reston Va.

Not a good start to this relationship.\\n@VerizonSupport I am not at home by the way ^JRA ❤️\\n@VerizonSupport Any update yet for the speeds to change over\\n@VerizonSupport @610826 Try another service provider that should do it\\n@VerizonSupport I will check.\\n@VerizonSupport So what your saying is that the only reason its on direct tv is because of expiring contracts?  but the chiller itself is disbanding?\\n@VerizonSupport How much do you guys slow down unlimited data. I can barely even render a YouTube video with LTE full bars.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless, do you have a lot of residential business abroad? I am not allowed to sign in now until you send an sms code which won’t work abroad. Why isn’t there another way to verify identity?\\n@VerizonSupport Your response time here is frightening\\n@VerizonSupport And one just hung up after being on hold, great customer support 👍🏾 @115725\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, no signal.

I don\\'t have residential.\\n@VerizonSupport Fios\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport Several times. Twice tonight and right now, it’s just a black screen.\\n@VerizonSupport I have a flashing DSL light and no internet light. No dial tone as far as I can tell.\\n@VerizonSupport It has been set up for a long time- prob over a year- maybe more. It does show online. That\\'s why it\\'s so confusing why I keep getting this paper bill. I travel a lot and mail often goes unopened for long periods of time- hence paperless billing.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks! Just trying to tell someone I\\'m signed up for paperless billing yet keep receiving a paper bill. No email notification until it\\'s late. Can you plz look into it? And someone should give us an option for help online w/out the ridiculous cost! :-)\\n@VerizonSupport wireless connection\\n@VerizonSupport Yep I ran a speed test with https://t.co/2pLzZEajYO and my speeds were normal.

Cable needs to get up with the times. People no longer want to subscribe to a fixed list of channels. They want to select channels a la carte. We don\\'t want to subsidize cable channels that provide unneeded services.\\n@VerizonSupport Gracias\\n@VerizonSupport Business\\n@VerizonSupport I canceled services within 30 days of installation.\\n@VerizonSupport The lady who called me spoke way too fast on her introduction to me, then was increasingly hostile to me during the call. She mumbled her companies name several times, and insisted my company owed a final bill that Verizon is not claiming settled. I owe nothing. My bill is final.\\n@VerizonSupport @649136 Thinking of moving to Sling where I can choose!\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t want ESPN. I never watch it. Ever.

Wtf!!!\\n@VerizonSupport I have hated every interaction with verizon support Ive ever had in the past 10 years Ive been a customer. plz just no.\\n@VerizonSupport However they never activate this # that was release by Verizon because we never asked them to get it, but Verizon seems to think we did.\\n@VerizonSupport The problem is Verizon then said our contract was broken, and so our bill went up. Now we’re paying more monthly for something we didn’t do.\\n@VerizonSupport Didn’t help at all same shit I been trying\\n@VerizonSupport All we want is to pay the price we paid for months before all of this happened with no impetus from us. It seems unlikely Verizon cant do so\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s residential. Can we DM? Otherwise these Twitter Devils will insult me.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. I’ve had two cases trying to fix it. Every month they promise it’s fixed. They say I have to wait for the next bill and it will show I don’t owe money. Four months now And now daily call telling me I owe money.\\n@VerizonSupport We tried to transfer service. The installer couldn’t get it to work so we had to cancel, but when it was canceled they took off tv and internet and left phone. You’ve been billing us $198/mo for phone we don’t have or want.\\n@VerizonSupport I DM’d and no reply. Another $500 bill and calls continuing saying I owe money. Very frustrated\\n@VerizonSupport wireless mobile\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/WzxDhRwjQW\\n@VerizonSupport Enrolled. Rep didn\\'t know????  He\\'s sitting in front of a computer.

Y\\'all are just being sneaky.\\n@VerizonSupport I redeemed that credit for 2g of bonus data but when I tried to use it I got a message to contact customer service.

Sorry it ended so poorly.\\n@VerizonSupport Bill went from $88 to $152 because I moved and you couldn\\'t fulfill my old contract.

As you may realise I am getting really pissed about this\\n@VerizonSupport Is one week reasonable?\\n@VerizonSupport Now the whole screen is frozen\\n@VerizonSupport It keeps telling me the channel is not available. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Like today. And yesterday.\\n@VerizonSupport That got me to a person.  They couldn\\'t help.  Sent me back to Frontier\\n@VerizonSupport Considering I’ve been paying for 75/75 for a year now, this really disappoints me. My son is watching YouTube on his phone. That’s the only streaming at this time https://t.co/C5TWWLgllO\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t have a hard wired connection at this thin.

No one touches them\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve sent 2 signals to my main stb and it’s still pixilated\\n@VerizonSupport Please just stop throttling I am done sending you all the info for you to say it is on my side.

All I have is this black box\\n@VerizonSupport I have spoken with support several times. I have a multiroom dvr box in my house and it works on the tv it is connected to but not on the other box in my house. I have tried a bunch of stuff. I want to replace my boxes. How do I go about that?\\n@VerizonSupport I only have 2 boxes. The box that has the dvr works but the second box can’t access the mrdvr. I just want to replace. At this time, I can’t afford to upgrade my service\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I was able to access the dvr remotely before\\n@VerizonSupport are you reading my responses? Again, I am on WiFi and this only happens with fios.\\n@VerizonSupport no... connected on WiFi\\n@VerizonSupport not the WiFi. Only happens with fios.\\n@VerizonSupport I only stream on my Mac book pro\\n@VerizonSupport a few weeks. Why does it happen?\\n@VerizonSupport Appreciate it. Hopefully resolved. It only took 1 1/2 hrs &amp; actually all I received is email confirmation that it\\'s being looked into, so hope they actually resolve it.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah obviously your shit doesn’t work!!!!\\n@VerizonSupport Yep.  In Nj, channel 1452.  The standard fios blackout message.  Not local, not nationally televised.  Seems to be exactly the scenario for which I subscribe\\n@VerizonSupport Chat service.

But thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport A supervisor figured out and solved the issue in 15 minutes where as the first person I spoke to couldn\\'t fix one issue in 35 minutes. Hope all of my experiences aren\\'t like this.\\n@VerizonSupport Yup! Had to ask for a supervisor after it took 35 minutes to reschedule installation. Still trying to solve the billing inquiry.\\n@VerizonSupport Can I get it without buying a third sports tier in addition to the two I already have?\\n@VerizonSupport Added local TV at the recommendation of agent to get better pricing, despite not having a TV. 1yr pricing ended and now stuck with extra $20/mo in total. Want to remove TV and downgrade internet (don’t need 100Mbps)\\n@VerizonSupport I have DM’d and have received no response nor any satisfaction-and I’m not really surprised-sadly\\n@VerizonSupport No, will it eliminate this? How do I do it? Also, I still don’t understand what the ^NHP in your reply means.\\n@VerizonSupport Gotcha. Thank you. ^NHP ^FEM ^OK\\n@VerizonSupport So the only way to keep my kids from seeing this is to cancel my service? Also, I don’t know what NHP means.\\n@VerizonSupport Hi there! Yes, I did. They told me they couldn\\'t come out until Tuesday, but I need it sooner.\\n@VerizonSupport Hi there! I don\\'t have fios. I live in an apartment community.\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry I wasn\\'t watching for reply!

Don\\'t know about the living room. It is old small screen CRT SD TV.\\n@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport respond! $150 a month , I deserve to watch pitt basketball before they inevitably tank their season\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.  Several times.\\n@VerizonSupport All devices\\n@VerizonSupport Their popup tells me to call verizon. It says that Verizon is slow to react... if I go back to them, they will tell me to go tro verizon. But thank you for your  consideration and advice.\\n@VerizonSupport No, I am yet to call Verizon. I thought you are a better choice. Incredimail told me to reload the account, I did, and nothing has changed. Verizon a year or two ago did the same. Each time it\\'s done it is loading thousands of past emails that have to be deleted.\\n@VerizonSupport There is a green light on above the ONT reset button. On the little hub it\\'s connected to, there are zero lights on\\n@VerizonSupport All my services are completely off. I\\'ve done the troubleshooting and rebooted the OTN and still nothing\\n@VerizonSupport Home. I’ve had this identical problem several times over. Rebooting didn’t help. Never does...\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n\\nShouldn’t matter. If you pay for 50 mbps and continually get less than 2, there is a problem\\n@VerizonSupport 51/56 plugged into the Ethernet cable\\n@VerizonSupport Lol. I’ve used more than one speed test site. Very little variance amongst them- same results. Multiple computers too...\\n@VerizonSupport So this is just a decoy on your site then? https://t.co/NVvocUUmqN\\n@VerizonSupport Understood if you could get me in touch with the folks that do.\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon now owns Yahoo\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I have they have not responded\\n@VerizonSupport I will send them privately\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I can.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Nevermind I signed up for it again and it worked. thank you so much for your patience ❤\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s why I\\'m wondering why the promo code didn\\'t work 😭\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah but I did it online on their website I signed up with the \\'promo code\\' then added the app but all i get is update payment\\n@VerizonSupport @136756  https://t.co/wwwXlpswMb\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile accounts, I’m having trouble closing a line even though my signed contract says I can leave anytime without penalty\\n@VerizonSupport Hello\\n@VerizonSupport Switch the 2-yr contract that’s not even supposed to be a thing to a normal payment plan.

Moving in2 a different unit. Charging me extra on my bill plus set up fee.\\n@VerizonSupport Apparently I need one but the unit has its own ONT and I’m using my own router. Someone also just moved out so it was in use recently.\\n@VerizonSupport Trust me i will be moving over to You guys in 5 days 🤗\\n@VerizonSupport My Verizon, &amp; 27 minutes later, it\\'s still stuck in spinning mode :(\\nLot of good the dumb \"VerizonUp\" thing is if I can\\'t even access it....\\n@VerizonSupport DDD? But I️ was aggressively spoken to the entire time, then told she hoped it wouldn’t harm my customer service review later. Truly 💯\\n@VerizonSupport (Aka: now looking forward to the day we can switch to @116136 or @ATT)\\n@VerizonSupport Just found a back way in, I\\'m ok now, thanks you.\\n@VerizonSupport If you don\\'t want to have that perception, I suggest: First, have your installation people follow instructions not to install a new router.\\n@VerizonSupport Sixth, when customer support says, \"Yes I\\'ll e-mail you a return label\", how about actually e-mailing it?\\n@VerizonSupport You need to train your people to handle these calls. Your tech had no clue what to say or do\\n@VerizonSupport This is what I am dealing with:  https://t.co/qFAUYmj0LY\\n@VerizonSupport @11164  Verizon Security at the Unlawful Call Center also claims there is nothing they can do to prevent callers from faking caller ID\\n@VerizonSupport @11164 @11164 Verizon instructed me to call the FCC.  (Verizon rep mistakenly referred me to the FTC).   I filed a complaint online.\\n@VerizonSupport I followed, but twitter won\\'t allow me to dm @verizonsupport\\n@VerizonSupport How is that I am on hold with customer service rn for 40+ mins but you answered my dumb tweet in under 4 ?\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/x62EcY54OD\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m having an issue with your customer support taking so long because of scripts they are told to follow instead of just solving the issue.\\n@VerizonSupport My concern is that it takes forever to get help because the agents have to send a bunch of stupid messages that don\\'t help.\\n@VerizonSupport I have questions about new services and new bill, and need to talk to a person.\\n@VerizonSupport I rebooted one of the boxes and it never came back online showed  loading and reboot  messages and never got farther—ie, no internet guide\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for trying to help—originally posted trying to get an outage  update. I’ll call local FIOS.\\n@VerizonSupport Both boxes are out simultaneously—the odds that the coax cables to both of them loosened at the same time are close to zero.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes—that message on both boxes.\\n@VerizonSupport I have been on the phone for over an hour. With the end result being in flat out terms “no matter what you do if you wanna keep this package you have your bill is going to go up 20 bucks. But wait if you delete 32 channels we will save you 2.76 cents a month!\\n@VerizonSupport I️ really should, I️ can certainly get a lot of people to drop spectrum real quick!! I’ve got 1000s of commitments ready to pull the plug #Cancelspectrum allday/everyday\\n@VerizonSupport Nah, there\\'s no problem. I just don\\'t watch enough to justify the extra $40/month.

Working now.\\n@VerizonSupport But it’s only that one channel. All other channels are working fine\\n@VerizonSupport It was happening on both boxes in the house.

What should I do?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, already disconnected and reset the ONT. Initially, only lights that were on are power (green), Ethernet (green), and MoCA (Amber).  Now only MoCA is on (red)\\n@VerizonSupport Haven\\'t had any TV/Internet/Phone for 5 hours, no troubleshooting steps have resolved the issue.  Will have to call back tomorrow morning\\n@VerizonSupport I am wired to my router.  Here is a speed test I just did from my iPhone via WiFi.

It\\'s now past that window and there isn\\'t a tech isn\\'t even assigned. This is for a repair to fire alarm telephone line that has been out for 3weeks. https://t.co/YrqIxRWOmt\\n@VerizonSupport Giving your paying customer the runaround for 7 hours transferring to various departments. Being told one thing and then something different the next. And not being able to fix the issue at hand. It is not okay.\\n@VerizonSupport We\\'re in a condo so it\\'s not in our house, it\\'s outside somewhere but for everyone\\'s unit\\n@VerizonSupport No, green power indicator only\\n@VerizonSupport YES\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, it\\'s next to the router.\\n@VerizonSupport Unfortunately, we tried that too. 😧 And just tried again but still turned red.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s not giving me the option to DM.\\n@VerizonSupport hopefully it sticks this time. I’ve been fighting this since last Friday, but Mike was knowledgeable and explained why it should stick.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless service. I pay too much a month for the service I\\'m receiving.

Unacceptable.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes there’s no account # on the sheet only an order number but on the activation site you need an account #\\n@VerizonSupport That’s the site I was on but this order number doesn’t work https://t.co/QepnVKCPGk\\n@VerizonSupport Just 580, MSG+ HD.

Just used phone to GPS directions 1/\\n@VerizonSupport ahead of time but $250 seems excessive. Plus VZW kept texting me to tell me of charges and I couldn\\'t check b/c was driving.\\n@VerizonSupport White\\n@VerizonSupport I did .\\n@VerizonSupport Go on....\\n@VerizonSupport I see a world light, and I see a WiFi light. They are both white, but it’ll most likely crash within the next 20 mins like it always does\\n@VerizonSupport My shit be crashing atleast 20 times a day soooooooooooo\\n@VerizonSupport That is the number in the email. It’s also the number I’ve been on hold with for 42 minutes.\\n@VerizonSupport Fios\\n@VerizonSupport Channel availability, ability to have equipment sent to a work address, confirming that work address and the next day I get an email saying it was mailed to my home. The mere fact there\\'s no record of these calls in my account.\\n@VerizonSupport The was a second call back on 10/9 in the afternoon but you called id asked with a + symbol so that won\\'t show on my phone record. With Verizon as well btw.\\n@VerizonSupport There is only record of one call of my minimum of 10 in the first 2 weeks after ordering and the fix was an insult to me\\n@VerizonSupport She’s fine, just a paper cut. But good luck telling a 1 year old to stay still and keep her bandaid on. 🙂\\n@VerizonSupport ok thanks I\\'ll try in a few\\n@VerizonSupport what will that do to all my social media tv connections\\n@VerizonSupport no problems started last week with a pretty strong windy storm\\n@VerizonSupport on the router ? no just unplug wait reply as I was told last time I called now I bypass the call just do myself working now but irritating\\n@VerizonSupport my router for Internet connection\\n@VerizonSupport https://t.co/fyrMnvebdg\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, your speed test consistently comes in way higher than any other services. And I don\\'t really care about speed tests. It took me like 3 minutes to load Twitter earlier today. AND your tech rep was rude to top it off. This is on a 150 Mbps plan. Sorry, we\\'re out! https://t.co/I235Lxxv9g\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t want Fios. I want cell coverage. I\\'m considering switching to Verizon prepaid\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular.\\n@VerizonSupport So i have to wait 90 days for my card... but my bill is due before then....\\n@VerizonSupport small business phone and internet (FIOS)\\n@VerizonSupport No... it\\'s now working.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m curious if I was to switch over to Verizon how much would it cost me?\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you so much\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport No clue....I’m connected to the 5G option\\n@VerizonSupport Ok then what?\\n@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport A sales rep lied to me, telling me that there was no internet set up fee/connection fee;yet, when I receive bill there was a setup/connection fee of $99. @118156\\n@VerizonSupport Moving my tv service to an address with internet only.  Current resident called to make arrangements.  Tech did not show up yesterday, zero notice given.  Now, internet is getting shut off before new service is installed.\\n@VerizonSupport It shouldn\\'t take two customers hours to resolve an issue.  This is incredibly frustrating.\\n@VerizonSupport She didn\\'t - she told me it would automatically be applied because more than one house was impacted - but they didn\\'t know that when I had my service scheduled to fix the outage.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 I\\'ve already looked into it I\\'ll have to pay 700 to pay off my s8plus I need some good incentives to do that\\n@VerizonSupport No problem, thanks so much for trying. I appreciate it.\\n@VerizonSupport yes\\n@VerizonSupport Outrageous!!!! representative only saying it\\'s an outage and nothing they can do. Doesn\\'t wanna send a device so we can call in the meantime, leaving pregnant women without any means to contact her dr should she go into labor.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, and they told me it was simply unavailable.\\n@VerizonSupport No, your \"High Speed Internet\" service is noncompetitive and useless to anyone even wanting to simply watch online video at any normal resolution, and your upload speed is literally a joke. \\n\\nVerizon is unwilling to set up Fios at my location, which makes me not interested.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you, I am actually on hold to speak with rep... have other concerns too long for tweeting. Thanks though.\\n@VerizonSupport Q: Why did Verizon get rid of special rates for customers of over 25 years? Bill doubled.\\n@VerizonSupport HI Jay - I spoke with Customer Service and they didn\\'t have an answer as why it ended.\\n@VerizonSupport Univision is only one of the nine channels that you removed, where is the link for the other eight? I am still paying Verizon for a contract which you are not respecting. In addition you don\\'t care about the customers. You still have the same update, nothing new\\n@VerizonSupport When I agreed to the service, I specifically asked whether I needed a box and was told definitively no. You guys are over-selling your services.\\n@VerizonSupport I have no idea whether it has a QAM tuner. Right now, I would be somewhat mollified if the app even worked.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve now been transferred to someone who says they are going to fix the problem. Since I spent 90 minutes with an agent Saturday with no result...I have my doubts.\\n@VerizonSupport You all have UNBELIEVABLY bad customer service. Everyone\\'s very nice and completely unable to help. Where do I go for my refund?\\n@VerizonSupport No but I had to pay $99 to get the service established. You can see the problem with that, I hope.\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure the exact name. It was $100 when I added the service as a \"fee\". There was no installation; it was a self-install. Unbelievable.\\n@VerizonSupport For the past hour, yes. I\\'m switching to Comcast.\\n@VerizonSupport Love how quick y’all are!  Looking at the availability and bundle offers now.\\n@VerizonSupport Android - Samsung S6. Worked for the first half of the match i was watching - then app crashed and had to reenter subscription verification, but keep getting this screen after selecting Verizon :(\\n@VerizonSupport Green\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve been through this already. I’d like to speak with a representative over the phone to schedule an appointment. I️ know what the issue -\\n@VerizonSupport Our WiFi has been shut off for weeks. Your technicians have done this before and for some reason nobody is willing to fix it now.\\n@VerizonSupport is there a way you can figure out which one of your representatives talked to me like this please\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless. It was a call asking abt credit card info for the account. I contacted a rep to tell them they have the wrong number.\\n@VerizonSupport We moved to an area with no fios sadly.\\n@VerizonSupport Unable to send DM until I receive a follow from you\\n@VerizonSupport I have. I\\'ve done it twice, still the same issue. Is there a way I can find which channel is the best?\\n@VerizonSupport please have them reach out to @92504 or me\\n@VerizonSupport yeap. I have phone ans internet\\n@VerizonSupport business\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, Ive ran both, running new ones right now, I have a friend in my area who its happening to as well.\\n@VerizonSupport Great... you guys have those channels in HD... awesome 👏🏼.. I need fios now!\\n@VerizonSupport Yep, almost an hour now.\\n@VerizonSupport New internet service\\n@VerizonSupport Trying to figure out when i can receive my order 🙇🏻\\u200d♀️\\n@VerizonSupport Not surprised but am disappointed that @115722 @VerizonSupport was a no-show for 2nd consecutive day. +8hrs wasted so far and counting!\\n@VerizonSupport Rescheduled after-the-fact, after wasting my entire Sun, only day I could spend w/ my family. No solutions or comp, only hollow apologies.\\n@VerizonSupport Just weirded out by people showing up at my front door and trying to sell me something without being able to know if they are who they claim to be.\\n@VerizonSupport Honestly I wasn’t happy with both the representatives and the manager and they should be reprimanded. I had no@idea that this is a reflection on Verizon Customer service.

Lol\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s for business.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok... What is the number? Can I contact them by email or on the website?\\n@VerizonSupport This is for cellular service\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, twice now that has worked at first but then after a few minutes it no longer can turn on/off the tv or volume. Only works for the box\\n@VerizonSupport @686265 @115990 Will you quit trying to ruin the internet?\\n@VerizonSupport Been stuck on this screen for 5 minutes... https://t.co/JRV1psw7QI\\n@VerizonSupport That was on 2016 Apple MBP. Following are from iPhone 7 https://t.co/x7QSdwnbZl\\n@VerizonSupport I do not own any devices that still have an Ethernet Port so I cannot hard wire. My Apple devices, and roommates’ Dell and Samsung devices are having the same issue. All are &lt;2 years old so they support the WiFi spec\\n@VerizonSupport They were set to \"Automatic\", I will try a few different channels to see if I have improved results. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport When I select the highest for 5G (165) I get the following message. Should that still be the one I select or choose a different one? I do not receive that message for any of the others. https://t.co/1BJER4V5qQ\\n@VerizonSupport Went with channel 11 for 2.4GHz, 161 for 5GHz. Laptop can now pickup the 5GHz band again but only when close to the router, seems installed Extender isn\\'t working very far, iPhone still not even recognizing 5GHz.\\n@VerizonSupport These are the speeds that I’m still getting inside my house 15 feet from the Signal Extender Verizon installed. Any recommendations beyond that? Obviously expecting better performance, no work can get done with those speeds. https://t.co/4Q4TU5Dthd\\n@VerizonSupport 14 show on iPhone, 27 on Apple MBP\\n@VerizonSupport As stated before, no laptops in the home have an Ethernet port. Besides, only install location for the Router was apparently in the garage so that\\'s not a viable option for us regardless.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ll try then @ you guys in the am. Thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport Good morning. No luck. Only the power light of on.\\n@VerizonSupport No luck. 😥\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. It\\'s not the outlet. I\\'ve checked.\\n@VerizonSupport 😟 No. Lol.

Only the power light.\\n@VerizonSupport It just goes out for like 10 minutes and then goes back up, are there outages in the new york long island area?\\n@VerizonSupport I am wired, but also my friend who lives not too far from me had the same problem. I haven\\'t looked at the router because it comes back relatively fast.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I\\'ve cancelled, but did not even get the usual text that notifies me of charges,  because #VerizonSucks .\\n@VerizonSupport *cancellation\\n@VerizonSupport How \\'bout you give me a way to contact someone who can actually help? I\\'ve already disputed the charge. #VerizonSucks\\n@VerizonSupport This the 2nd time this has happened\\n@VerizonSupport The replace battery light is on but status light is green.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport then you explain that clearly in the first call... not the 4th....\\n@VerizonSupport I was told by the phone rep, to renew my FIOS contract, go get the phone service, then to come back to give you my account number for VZW and then the credit will be applied for bundling...did your rep just lie to me?!?!?1\\n@VerizonSupport the promo is right on your front page of the residential tab on your website....\"switch to Verizon wireless and get 250 off your FIOS in bill credits....\"\\n@VerizonSupport i just got VZW yesterday.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 They dont deal with the FIOS team that issues the credits....both the phone rep and in store rep said to me when i asked...dont play the switharo game.\\n@VerizonSupport Hello?

It is so slow that I cannot load Verizon’s own speed test page! I have to hotspot from my mobile to use my laptop. I can’t get any help from support phone line or online.\\n@VerizonSupport This is a cellular order.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m in the process of doing that now. I even removed and readded the channel. And restarted the Roku. This happen on the Xbox as well\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, no problem\\n@VerizonSupport Same issue\\n@VerizonSupport Rajesh helped me!

Remove tv.\\n@VerizonSupport Trying to change services on my account. Your lovely (sarcasm) chat representative couldn’t explain to me how a random 1 year contract extension was added to my account.....\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m doing some kind of test thing. I think IPTV.\\n@VerizonSupport Odd they don’t provide their top show. That’s all I’m saying.\\n@VerizonSupport It just doesn\\'t give me the option? 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ it says \\'watch on tv\\' or \\'record\\'\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/BWBXjobhZI\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t have wired connections to test.\\n@VerizonSupport This indicates FIOS services.\\n\\nI don\\'t have FIOS. (Wish I did.) I have DSL. https://t.co/1pOuLwR1Ux\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. This isn\\'t a router issue. It\\'s a DSL issue. Believe me. Any DSL outages in the East Brunswick NJ area? That link I was given appeared to be only for FIOS.\\n@VerizonSupport DSL light is blinking green. Honestly. I\\'ve had this issue for the last month. I\\'ve had enough. I\\'d rather pay 3x as much for xfinity (my only other option here) than deal with this.\\n@VerizonSupport The service I\\'ve had since early October has been awful. Drops constantly. Many reboots required. Today not working all day. Techs have been out 2x. As I said I have a callback sched from 800#. SO ridiculous.\\n@VerizonSupport Like can y’all fix this or return my money $250 is a lot I could use elsewhere seeing as i don’t have WiFi in my home\\n@VerizonSupport Service was active for a week before I left I had an old router I used and it worked but January 11th it stopped working and\\n@VerizonSupport Router then I left for basic training in the  Air Force and nothing ever happened it’s been almost 2 years !\\n@VerizonSupport Reported? I asked why you don\\'t offer home internet service in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\\n@VerizonSupport Where\\'s my bills I should get some months I never see my bills what kind of business shit y\\'all runing\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport Can I DM you photos?\\n@VerizonSupport I have a bulk service agreement for my apartment complex which allows me to have a set Technology Package rate. They claim I owe an extra $63.99 when I pay my rent on the 1st of each month and paid my tech package already. Customer service didn’t help after 30 minutes.\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t have the pin because my dad died last month I’m tryin to fix our account. I can’t do anything in the store &amp; can’t talk to a real person on the phone honestly about to switch carriers I should be able to contact with a fucking human being!\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport wireless mobile. I keep getting Extended and 1X on my service bar and I can\\'t send or receive phone calls, texts or anything unless I\\'m on wifi.\\n@VerizonSupport well I️ was forced to. Was told Thursday at first, but no Monday. Again, bad news after bad news.\\n@VerizonSupport original appoint was set for today. Apparently my request wasn’t even logged in correctly on your end. Told they can have someone here on Thursday, but now it’s Monday. A week from the original date.\\n@VerizonSupport My videos never play I have to disconnect from my fios and connect to my Sprint that’s why I say this https://t.co/SVzESNettj\\n@VerizonSupport Kimberly\\n@VerizonSupport I am now on your chat platform\\n@VerizonSupport Brought my friend from sprint and they offered him to pay for his cancellation of service.

I had to close the app on the roku and open it again. Thanks for the prompt reply\\n@VerizonSupport Yes ... the output is from Fios app\\n@VerizonSupport Why would any of those two problems cause key presses to be delayed? I don\\'t push the button again, it only registers after significant time.\\n@VerizonSupport You guys must have forgotten the part where you actually tell me to reboot. Good thing some of us can extrapolate from incomplete data. Reboot is definitely better advice than change the batteries or is there a glass case...\\n@VerizonSupport I only have one box.\\n@VerizonSupport When I turn the box on (press menu button), sometimes the button clicks don\\'t register for a significant amount of time. I\\'ve tried channel up/down, guide, on demand. None work until the box decides it\\'s good and ready, then all buttons pressed happen at once.\\n@VerizonSupport Cell service\\n@VerizonSupport This is what I get no matter what device I use. Don\\'t want ur app, thx but no.\\n@VerizonSupport Multiple devices. And no, but i do have to go in my settings and manually reconnect. IF the connection even pops up as an option\\n@VerizonSupport can\\'t even ping them. all devices. So it is not my Mac. I can visit those sites via my phone\\'s hotspot or at home or on a VPN. No messages, purely timesout.\\n@VerizonSupport 50% of random websites like cnn, stackoverflow etc etc? I already have some support/network trying to fix it controlling my screen. And they couldn\\'t fix it. Then I was promised a technician call or visit.\\n@VerizonSupport With all the respect, I think I am going over the same conversations again. I have a reference number and I need the technician to come fix it as promised on the phone.\\n@VerizonSupport I was told I would be contacted yesterday\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless, fam\\n@VerizonSupport Just freezes completely.

Top box connections in room not available\\n@VerizonSupport No problem... can you check on next steps for us?\\n@VerizonSupport I can pay $5/day to use plan I have, or buy 400 MB at a time, or buy a 1 GB/month plan that a technician later assured me doesn\\'t exist\\n@VerizonSupport yes\\n@VerizonSupport Just moved.

Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport No, all green. Before I did the reset, the internet light was flashing amber though.\\n@VerizonSupport It worked for a little bit and now it’s down again.\\n@VerizonSupport It keeps going in and out.

But, I said to us that I can\\'t from some numbers, and we saw that these number are Verizon\\'s number.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular. Whether it’s at work or at home. It’s just not good.\\n@VerizonSupport I checked and all the cables look in order. This happened last week but it fixed it self.

Last week!)\\n@VerizonSupport Can you please simply look at my account and turn on what was turned off last week?\\n@VerizonSupport Can you do it 24 hours/ day?\\n@VerizonSupport Over the past week and do what you said you would do?\\n@VerizonSupport Do I need to be in my house?\\n@VerizonSupport I have been calling *611 and getting recording that is outside of office hours\\n@VerizonSupport I have no internet. I am tweeting on my iPhone, which is working for internet. But honestly my cellular service has been spotty for the last 9 months, after 13 years of being excellent.\\n@VerizonSupport In July, it appears you began billing me separately for two landlines (one of which I didn’t even know existed). One bill started coming by paper. Since it wasn’t a familiar # (607-722-0478), I ignored it until September 20, when I spent about 2 hours in the phone with you.\\n@VerizonSupport Well she is currently in Nigeria, and would like to purchase the iPhone X, but doesn\\'t know if the network would work in Nigeria if unlocked.\\n@VerizonSupport @707265 Hi can i send you a dm?\\n@VerizonSupport Just on one tv\\n@VerizonSupport I’ll have to call Verizon. We did all that several times and still nothing. Thank you for helping\\n@VerizonSupport No service in the middle of town, not even outside of town.

Through other ISPs they work\\n@VerizonSupport not to familiar with twitter so I assume this is the Chat your referring to?\\n@VerizonSupport my zip code is 15960 if you need it\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport I believe more to it. It’s intermittent over past few months. Please check it out. 618-465-3484. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport 718 sorry\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Just need to change our friend Scott’s cell number for a month, but change it back in December when we need to contact him. Thx 4 help.\\n@VerizonSupport Just a couple of laptops and and desktops.  Not streaming anything.  No need to spend more time on the phone.  Maybe tomorrow.\\n@VerizonSupport My Wifi isn\\'t working and already tried rebooting. Still on hold btw. Hour and 15 min and counting\\n@VerizonSupport Yes the top light is red\\n@VerizonSupport Just my wifi and internet. Cable is working fine and I don\\'t have a land line.\\n@VerizonSupport The WAN light  is not on currently on. The LAN button is currently on and green.\\n@VerizonSupport I do not. Don\\'t know if we even have 1\\n@VerizonSupport No just looked in the spots We would\\'ve have stored it. Don\\'t have 1\\n@VerizonSupport I have been having issues for about a week. I was on the phone with tech support yesterday and I think we narrowed it down to the issue being my extender. It doesn\\'t change names to reflect what my network is and it\\'s messing things up.\\n@VerizonSupport 2 of 2. I wasn\\'t able to thoroughly go over everything with the tech because I needed to go out. Thought it was ok\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t think so. I thought it synced automatically\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport Can you send it to me? I’m at wits end with this. I have had issues for days.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, the globe/earth looking icon is red\\n@VerizonSupport Have unplugged router for 10 seconds and plugged it back in\\n@VerizonSupport Ooh it’s wireless and it’s happening on two lines.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I thought you were.

And now I don\\'t have any\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you! I\\'m especially thrilled because I was already under contract, but still got the cost savings of re-upping. Woohoo! :)\\n@VerizonSupport Unless you are going to give me the same deal you\\'d offer a new subscriber, lets not waste each others time. I have been using Fios for 10 years. There is no other option for me and you guys know that, which is why I get price gouged.\\n@VerizonSupport Router drops starts dropping signal ever 2-3 months. They repair with a new one and same thing keeps happening on schedule\\n@VerizonSupport Repair technician just replaced the router again today for like 5th time but that doesn\\'t solve anything!!\\n@VerizonSupport I shouldn\\'t have to keep dealings with this\\n@VerizonSupport I just find it funny. Retaining customers is hard and expensive. It\\'s far better to keep your customers happy and offer good service than restrict new deals to new customers... Bitter as gigabit came out 3 weeks after I started with you.\\n@VerizonSupport You\\'re right! Each \"deal\" asks for more $$$, and offers benefits your new customers get included in their low price. Why not simply offer your shackled customers the new customer deals?\\n@VerizonSupport 3. Never have service at my home. Even though you never show issues in the service area. I don’t live in a cave. Still no resolution to that! So, I’m fed up to say the least\\n@VerizonSupport 1: Cellular billing. Called in per the suggestion of your CSR to pay bill early - did so and the next day you charged me again..so, now your financial services department is saying that they won’t even REVIEW it until November 22nd and then it will be days after that before\\n@VerizonSupport I was , she\\'s isn\\'t very helpful, I call to ask why my bill is rising randomly, and Carol is trying to upsell me on other products.\\n@VerizonSupport @710990 Send that Moran back...he switch my line to another floor\\n@VerizonSupport It turned out to be taxes. But Carol made it seem like I was lying about the issues with my DVR. I never had these issues w/ @115955 . @115722  get it together https://t.co/8gtEfhSWqU\\n@VerizonSupport Nope, shows were disappearing from my drv when they became available for purchase on VOD. Carol questioned my logic on whether that made sense or not. I pay for things to stay on my DVR. Carol reminded me I only pay $8.But my cancellation fee is only $60. #idontneedtheseproblems\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, more specifically the connection im receiving using my Google pixel as a hotspot. I used to get quadruple the speeds I\\'m currently getting just 3 days ago\\n@VerizonSupport I need to speak to someone about the charges on my bill and issues with my drv.\\n@VerizonSupport Haven’t had internet or tv services for a while. Tried resetting the modem, Verizon box in the basement - nothing\\n@VerizonSupport hi jay! the power never went out. just the modem stopped working.\\n@VerizonSupport just tried it. nothing changed. same lights.\\n@VerizonSupport just tried it. same lights are back. no change.\\n@VerizonSupport no. i have no idea what that is. do you have a photo?\\n@VerizonSupport I can’t find it 😞\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve looked everywhere. There’s nothing hanging on any walls or hidden anywhere. Is it possible we don’t have one?\\n@VerizonSupport Cable box is super slow to react to changing channels,menus, etc. ruled out remote and cycled power on STB. Other box works fine\\n@VerizonSupport Ok, did that. Seemed faster at first then slowed way down again\\n@VerizonSupport No change....\\n@VerizonSupport Nope\\n@VerizonSupport When I use the arrow buttons on the STB it works fine. Just the remotes...\\n@VerizonSupport And when I use the remotes on my other box it works perfectly.\\n@VerizonSupport By chat do you mean messages?\\n@VerizonSupport Just says this for hours https://t.co/Ri1Wfm27Yg\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure. It’s my cell service. The WiFi is fine.\\n@VerizonSupport Fixed the problem. Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport Clear dial tone, no static\\n@VerizonSupport Same thing happened, globe was blinking then it went red\\n@VerizonSupport Yea i know where it is\\n@VerizonSupport I’m connected to WiFi, but my connection is limited. DNS can’t be reached\\n@VerizonSupport I couldn’t access it, I have poor cell service atm. My zip code is 11731, if you could check for me\\n@VerizonSupport I do have an existing order NY00344551655. My issue was I couldn\\'t get FIOS, but with a spectacular new home, I should have it.\\n@VerizonSupport Problem is back again\\n@VerizonSupport Tried three times and I keep getting kicked out. Don\\'t have the time to try a fourth time right now\\n@VerizonSupport Safari for iOS. Not the smoothest experience\\n@VerizonSupport I can, but it\\'s getting late. We\\'ll have to try to resolve the issue another time\\n@VerizonSupport I can just simply pop it open? Or are there screws in it? It doesn\\'t seem to be budging, but it might have been the angle I was trying it at\\n@VerizonSupport I got it open, just a little stuck. Where do I find a replacement battery for this? It\\'s a 12VDC 7AH battery. Never seen one before.\\n@VerizonSupport I’m located in zip code 08824\\n@VerizonSupport I went through the troubleshooting steps but it didn’t help 😢 https://t.co/eIfAxpKyhz\\n@VerizonSupport It didn\\'t work.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve reset it twice now and I have no issues with backup battery box\\n@VerizonSupport Captcha: https://t.co/IUBm5cfEf7\\n@VerizonSupport Sooo...\\n\\nNothin?\\n@VerizonSupport Most all websites I’ve tried to visit have not loaded when on VZW LTE. Have to be on WiFi to be able to attain normalcy.\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile. iPhone 7. Tampa area.\\n@VerizonSupport Please have them call me, Im sick &amp; tired of your non-functional phone tree systems. I got this earlier when attempting 2 complete your 2FA https://t.co/7S6QU5UxZg\\n@VerizonSupport Been on the phone with 3 people for 54 minutes, and the representative is just getting angry *at me* because his computer system doesn\\'t allow this, which obviously is not really helping me. Perhaps we should move to DM? 😶\\n@VerizonSupport I tried to yesterday but no one ever picked up. Was on hold for over 25 minutes waiting for a representative\\n@VerizonSupport Orange\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Multiple times yesterday. I even reset the battery unit twice\\n@VerizonSupport How? It’s taking me a login page or a check if fios is available. But either way, how does that help? I’ll tell you - there’s been an purge since 830am yesterday. When will you fix ?\\n@VerizonSupport As always, thank you for the quick response!\\n@VerizonSupport My Customer Service Rep was extremely helpful. Thanks for contacting me.\\n@VerizonSupport I did that, and when they called me back, the call disconnected. Currently on hold again, for 12-20 minutes,\\n@VerizonSupport I’m moving this Saturday and my new apartment is already set up for Comcast.

Thanks for the replies btw\\n@VerizonSupport no nothing happens. no message just when i find the movie or show i want and click on it to watch bothing happens.\\n@VerizonSupport No, not currently watching if you mean real time. DVR twice, two weeks in a row, happened both times on repeat airing after the original new airing. And episode is not On Demand so I can\\'t see it until it airs again.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. But read the tweets, it\\'s happening live for other people, so it records that way.\\n@VerizonSupport Further thought, were I able to watch this in real time, I would. I can\\'t, that\\'s why DVR. You\\'ve been notified there\\'s a problem, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY and look into it. We pay you significant household $ for service, we shouldn\\'t be serving you. Signed, annoyed longtime customer.\\n@VerizonSupport if i type in 517, it just goes to 515. i\\'ve never had this issue.\\n@VerizonSupport NOT AT ALL; why would you say that!

Nothing indicating on demand.\\n@VerizonSupport I do not, we DVR everything or watch live. We missed that this show was airing and wanted to catch up before Monday.\\n@VerizonSupport yup.

The three dots are rolling then it closes https://t.co/g4tS5LD18l\\n@VerizonSupport These canned responses just annoy your customers\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve tried both the app on my iPhone as well as Firefox on a computer. Same message both ways.\\n@VerizonSupport I call and they said they cannot help. 😞\\n@VerizonSupport If my phone worked internationally and i wasn’t charged for it, that would be nice\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'d liked to bring them to a location if possible. Is there a zip code lookup on your website?\\n@VerizonSupport Unfortunately those locations won\\'t work -- way too far out of the way. Can I go the shipping route? Do I just require there account number?\\n@VerizonSupport Ok but is there a way to turn it off? It\\'s connected electrically so I\\'m paying the electric bill for it?\\n@VerizonSupport I no longer have the service so customer servuce told me I had to remove the box myself. The way the original technician installed it has wires connected every which way.\\n@VerizonSupport In the tweet I sent to you, I used your speed test vs. https://t.co/8lRkYT0g4o. There is an 800mbps difference.\\n@VerizonSupport I have FiOS and am only using Verizon equipment. I\\'m 1 room over from the primary router...maybe 15 feet.\\n@VerizonSupport *unless the results are good enough for @115722 to RT.\\n@VerizonSupport @286702 “We only support speed servers where we can fudge the numbers.” - Fixed that for you.\\n@VerizonSupport What is the best way to get in contact when a higher tier of support or a manager?\\n@VerizonSupport Issue resolved but there really needs to be a “human service” for your elderly customers...\\n@VerizonSupport Residential\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure how it keeps happening if the account is being noted.\\n@VerizonSupport Away for weekend came home no cable or internet. Restarted router twice. Can see Wi-Fi network but can’t get on the internet\\n@VerizonSupport Said my wait time was 4 min...wth?m https://t.co/OA6JnjbbTa\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, it would be great if finally someone can confirm the installation appointment and send him an email with the order number.\\n@VerizonSupport No, the Business owner didn\\'t receive that yet. He\\'s leaving Optimun bc of poor CS.\\n@VerizonSupport New Jersey. West orange\\n@VerizonSupport Residential.\\n@VerizonSupport There is no blinking light in my router. I have reset the router already.\\n@VerizonSupport Rebooting now. I pressed the reset button\\n@VerizonSupport Which one should be blinking\\n@VerizonSupport But they stop periodically.\\n@VerizonSupport The antennae light is blinking.\\n@VerizonSupport Now I see the word internet on the side. Lol\\n@VerizonSupport Also please see my original tweet in this thread - I am not able to sign into my mother\\'s account from my verizon phone\\n@VerizonSupport it keeps telling me my log in credentials don\\'t match the device\\n@VerizonSupport Yes online chat.  “no outage” - but all techs are busy until Wed?  My job depends on online access - I need a company who understands that!\\n@VerizonSupport Unplugging and removing battery?  Yes, tried that twice\\n@VerizonSupport Just the green light - system status\\n@VerizonSupport Westchester\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless!\\n@VerizonSupport Here you go. https://t.co/XPkh05tko8\\n@VerizonSupport No better results. Lol https://t.co/7dcwkQLmXG\\n@VerizonSupport Now this is all I get. I even tried other speed tests but none will connect https://t.co/JS3Umftuqu\\n@VerizonSupport Yep\\n@VerizonSupport Fios\\n@VerizonSupport I know my building doesn\\'t have FIOS. This doesn\\'t tell me when it will, so not helpful. My landlord has requested it over and over again!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it worked thank you 😭😭😭\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport @726148 if only prices were as similar as optimum :{\\n@VerizonSupport They have DSL.\\n@VerizonSupport Your company is a parasite leeching of your monopoly on my town.\\n@VerizonSupport I hate this!\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah\\n@VerizonSupport Did that. Still nothing. Thanks anyway\\n@VerizonSupport Skippack pa\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah. They are all green except the VID is red\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular.\\n@VerizonSupport Both\\n@VerizonSupport Not really. Internet gets spotty and slow at times.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope it’s our whole town! #sucks #help\\n@VerizonSupport Nope already spoke to someone service won’t be restored until 6:15pm at the earliest. Thanks for making me miss the @135926 game.\\n@VerizonSupport Tv is blank. Just let’s me reboot the box. The box reboots, goes blank and has dashed across the box screen. All boxes are out.\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport Good but how ?!\\n@VerizonSupport Who deals with Ethernet.  Not DSL service\\n@VerizonSupport Not Fios. It’s a point to point Ethernet circuit\\n@VerizonSupport //Well it\\'d be nice if my Wi-Fi actually worked.\\n@VerizonSupport I see ^BCW &lt;3\\n@VerizonSupport Yes i did they made a “ticket”\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon telecom truck and pole company is about 3 miles up the road here. Heck of a response time when I have wires on the ground...\\n@VerizonSupport Why is this so hard to understand. More pictures? https://t.co/mLCk5jpPKv\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/YydvEneeKa\\n@VerizonSupport See the nice new pole? That was installed months ago and no matter who I call nobody will re-wire it.The old one just broke and its a mess!\\n@VerizonSupport Any updates at all? It\\'s impossible to get through by calling, so I\\'m hoping to get some sort of answer here.\\n@VerizonSupport Laurel, MD\\n@VerizonSupport The internet light is red, the Wi-Fi light is white as normal. And I\\'ve reset it multiple times.\\n@VerizonSupport I do.\\n@VerizonSupport Did that, no change.\\n@VerizonSupport Internet degraded and/or off-and-on since ~12AM Wednesday. Numerous calls to @115725. Repeated \"outages\". MDDQ0NX23V MDDQ0NXGUA MDDQ0NX8PG\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon has overhead utilities in the area- we are not sure who still has lines on the fragment of pole. This need to be addressed\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon wireless.\\n@VerizonSupport This was caused by a vehicle crash on Easter Morningdoa new pole was erected and overhead service was moved except for a few lines.\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile\\n@VerizonSupport no answer yet https://t.co/F5oiV95sKb\\n@VerizonSupport I did what you asked. It\\'s just a bot. What a shame. And it asks me to sign in to my account, but insists on sending me an authorization pin that i CANNOT RECEIVE because my SERVICE HAS BEEN DOWN FOR TWO DAYS.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport It is. For delivery of the Pixel 2 XL\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless service    Without WiFi I have no service. Others have said the same thing.  No apps will load nor messages will send.\\n@VerizonSupport No they lost our ticket. This happens every month. I need WiFi tonight.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. I want to cancel and order a different FIOS service.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Do I need a new password\\n@VerizonSupport I was just wondering if I could do the router myself?\\n@VerizonSupport I rebooted the iPad and My Fios  app will still not open/execute.  I will delete it and reinstall to see if that helps.  Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport The reinstall worked.  Thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport When I touch it to open on my iPad, it acts as if it is opening then goes to a black screen which then disappears and I am back on my iPad home screen.\\n@VerizonSupport Good evening, just followed. This may not be anything you can help with. But basically, Boomerang (channel 258) slightly changed its schedule at 1am this week with different shows. FiOS schedule still has Looney Tunes showing at that time\\n@VerizonSupport I only have one cable box on one tv and that\\'s how it shows there. Here\\'s a screenshot of the 1am schedule from the FiOS app as well. https://t.co/sF4I3YlUIk\\n@VerizonSupport That hasn\\'t helped; my box was updated/rebooted overnight on Sunday &amp; I didn\\'t read about the schedule change for that station until yesterday. To be fair though, this may be widespread as I looked at another cable provider\\'s schedule in my area for 1am &amp; it shows the same thing\\n@VerizonSupport Why? You\\'re just going to tell me I have to call back tommorow.\\n@VerizonSupport Trying to remove TV service.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok I did!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it says I already have an account and when I request a new password I don\\'t get an email or text message.\\n@VerizonSupport I need information on my order I placed and access to the online account. I am not able to register\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve sat on the phone for 40 minutes and not one person can tell me what is on my order, my appointment time, my cost, if I can add another receiver, or get me access online.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m paying $155.02/mo for 25mbit business FiOS, which is roughly 50% more $ than 100mbit business from Optimum.  So you can see why I\\'m in a bind.. A quarter the speed at 1.5x the price.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s nothing personal, because all the people I\\'ve dealt with at VZ have been nice.  But ur systems are a mess.  I just spent over an hour on the phone setting up a service upgrade.  (That \"our offices are closed\" thing was a red herring. Apparently they were open.)\\n@VerizonSupport Your pole tagged \"Bell Tel Co of PA\" 189/3\\n@VerizonSupport Called 800# in local directory 11/2/17, reached Philadelphia call center, who would not connect me to Washington county. \\nPromised would be fixed next day.\\n@VerizonSupport Read #history\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t have your \"ticket number\" because I had the silly idea #Verizon might this time be honest (despite the long sad tale of why I am no longer your customer)\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the quick reply, I\\'m getting calls about an \"order I placed\" which is suspicious.\\n@VerizonSupport They do not specify, only reference an order # and to call back. Google leads me to Verizon forums w/ said phone #\\n@VerizonSupport No orders have been placed, it\\'s a family account. Wanting to ensure it\\'s not fraud.\\n@VerizonSupport Right... I\\'m on the phone with your people now. Your supervisor said that they can\\'t do anything about it.\\n@VerizonSupport I wish. Been there done that. I don\\'t think you\\'re paying attention. Just bc you tweet doesn\\'t mean you\\'re helping.\\n@VerizonSupport Could I have your number to call?\\n@VerizonSupport I am in Philadelphia and a few of my neighbors have Verizon or want to switch. How quick can I make this happen\\n@VerizonSupport I know the pin for the account to verify\\n@VerizonSupport Yes my phone # is 318-315-2143\\n@VerizonSupport What magic must I follow? I gave my questions, there\\'s been no answers.  Don\\'t give me a phone # to call, that system sucks big time.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes; on my notebook &amp; my desktop.  Verizon Internet simply drops; my Neflix movies get interrupted, all this happens daily at least once.\\n@VerizonSupport Usually I reboot the router.\\n@VerizonSupport 9/13 I was sent all info for billing, etc. 9/18 technician came out, said my building was not equipped and that it would be ~$500 to install\\n@VerizonSupport I just spent an hour on the phone with a rep who  insinuated I was lying. I called on Sept 13 to setup service.\\n@VerizonSupport I verified and no service at my address but the whole neighborhood has service including next door neighbor\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s working again :)\\n@VerizonSupport No thank you. Been there done that.  I’m done. Once you lose my husband’s patience our service will be elsewhere\\n@VerizonSupport Both my TVs\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/93RYkPfJnA\\n@VerizonSupport Tried it and it didn’t work\\n@VerizonSupport Too late they had to replace computer to get fios to even kind of work. But as long as you all collect your money #verizonfios can make profits\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Ok, done ✅\\n@VerizonSupport Everything is working correctly now\\n@VerizonSupport From which devices? I only see one device. https://t.co/LjY2WMEVdT\\n@VerizonSupport Unplugged and now plugged back in. Just waiting for them to reset\\n@VerizonSupport Still having the same error\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport How do I do that?\\nAlso, how would that help if this is only affected 1 show not multiple?\\n@VerizonSupport I can access and play other recorded content. And yes I can still pause and rewind live TV\\n@VerizonSupport This is the error message.  It takes a while to even show this.  It only happens with this show regardless of episode https://t.co/l0XFyUqizy\\n@VerizonSupport right but forcing the use of a Verizon router is ridiculous. Your router is basic compared to a nighthawk, that I can\\'t use\\n@VerizonSupport Phone services\\n@VerizonSupport YOUR COUSTOMER SERVICE!\\n@VerizonSupport Can you fix the neighborhood-wide cable outage before December\\n@VerizonSupport All wireless. Cut cable and upgraded for streaming purposes and ps4 online.\\n@VerizonSupport Not on mine, main FIOS router seems fine. In going to try restarting it for 30 seconds and if that doesn\\'t work I\\'ll try the main settings.\\n@VerizonSupport Seems to have worked, I\\'ll contact again if the problem persists. This is an older model Asus router, but its usually just fine.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s actually been on anything I watch today, in the middle of a show or the game it will randomly go to commercial, always two, in low def even on hd channels, then back to show or game. I\\'m in Maryland, has to be a feed issue I think.\\n@VerizonSupport Had no connection at all earlier in the day, rebooted the router and now I can connect, but it\\'s super slow.\\n@VerizonSupport How long is the test supposed to take? I clicked on the link, but the window just keeps flickering between this and a blank white screen. https://t.co/gHYkF4RacK\\n@VerizonSupport Right now, I\\'m having problems watching a live stream via Youtube. Paid to watch an international game, but all I see is a frozen screen and \"Loading...\"\\n@VerizonSupport ok! quick question, what do the letters at the bottom of your tweets mean?\\n@VerizonSupport i think my ONT might be broken, ive had to do this several times and it all leads back to the unit. also, theres a green telecommunication box on our street that has all of the coax and fiber optic wires exposed... yikes!\\n@VerizonSupport yes, i have the second model from the left.\\n@VerizonSupport yes the light is red. tv and phone are both working fine\\n@VerizonSupport okay\\nForgot to tag @VerizonSupport oops\\n@VerizonSupport My internet keeps cutting in and out.\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry, false alarm. Thought the number I needed help with was with Verizon\\n@VerizonSupport Cell services\\n@VerizonSupport Wait was over 1hr this morn but 16min by 4pm. Vz had huge prob but Support read from script. A 7+ yr acct but can\\'t find/can\\'t help????\\n@VerizonSupport It began to work last night, thanks for checking.\\n@VerizonSupport There were outrage, my issue is that I called this morning, was told fixed in PM, now first avail was tech visit on Friday, poor service\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve done that. I have no problem with some sites (Hulu, Netflix, NFL, CBS). But twitter/Facebook seem to hang/pause waiting on the network. If I switch to LTE - suddenly it works. Somewhere in the stack there is a bug (on device) or a throttle on the traffic (network shaping).\\n@VerizonSupport things are better now. If/when I see the slowness I’ll run it again. https://t.co/SEaj05yAFL\\n@VerizonSupport Over the summer I think. My wife started to mention it. Since it comes and goes we mostly ignore it. This morning it was a very stark contrast.\\n@VerizonSupport Appreciated. Technically installation was in July. Perhaps you should also look into why the lines at customer service keep getting disconnected?\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you. 1st bill paid in August 2017\\n@VerizonSupport Residential, FiOS. But I’ve had the issue before. Your speed test tool says I do, every other speed test tool says I don’t.\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve never gotten less than 988mbps down on your site, even when I very clearly am not getting that. It is an unreliable source, IMO.\\n@VerizonSupport It’s fine. I am experiencing no issues now. \\n\\nI just want to relay the feedback that make your speed test tool shouldn’t be the end all, be all because it *is* inaccurate sometimes.\\n@VerizonSupport he did some wiring.\\n@VerizonSupport my landline phone service did not work\\n@VerizonSupport yes because there was an issue with my service.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I do. I’ve had it since August 2016 but recently moved, which resulted in a lot of problems.\\n@VerizonSupport Have customer support email me back. I sent a description of what was going on but nobody replied. Can I dm you?\\n@VerizonSupport MAHM01JE6E\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless mobile\\n@VerizonSupport Cell.  Over 30 in less than 2 days.\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t have a tv. No red lights. I unplugged and plugged back in but no. It’s green but nothing is happening\\n@VerizonSupport I did that but it didn’t work. This is what my router looks like https://t.co/6l9qwiJ730\\n@VerizonSupport fios\\n@VerizonSupport i was on chat with you all yesterday for over 30 minutes with no resolution. i scheduled a call at 11 today where you called and hung up. seriously about to jump ship. is there a live person somewhere?\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular data and NC\\n@VerizonSupport I only have the WiFi and it’s been down since around 3pm.\\n@VerizonSupport Solid red light\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Went back to being solid red after about 2 minutes and hasn’t changed. Is there a service outage?\\n@VerizonSupport Your site is only showing me FAQ’s on that page, no info about outages\\n@VerizonSupport As I just set up my service I have not set up my account yet. I am in brooklyn and according to several other sites there’s an outage.\\n@VerizonSupport I think I\\'ve talked to everyone  in the past couple months. was told all was good a month ago, today a collection letter arrived.\\n@VerizonSupport No. I cancelled my service that is where all the trouble started\\n@VerizonSupport Nooooooo! My husband retired early from VZ. He will be home soon and maybe he\\'ll want to continue. @100352\\n@VerizonSupport He\\'s on the way now and he will. Our numbers and address are the same. We pay for the home phone but they address it to Bell Atlan I think.\\n@VerizonSupport I did. Nothing happened . There’s a light on next to Replace Battery.\\n@VerizonSupport I have almost no cell signal inside my home. Need regular phone as mom in nursing home hospice and they need to be able to reach me.\\n@VerizonSupport Hello?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. The service number for my outage is my home : 4104536767\\n@VerizonSupport We just updated our bundle to a new FIOS package which triggered a new account number. Our last payment went to to old account to zero it.\\n@VerizonSupport Right. I should try to get to a website with terrible phone service and no internet. Great advice\\n@VerizonSupport from chat You: I have 50mb\\nAdam: For 50/50 Mbps you can get price around $39.99 + $10 Router + taxes and fees.\\n\\nAdam: It will be around $52\\n@VerizonSupport Kinda late now, Just got off the phone with \"Daphne\" she said nothing better could be done. If someone wants to offer me 39.99 before am, ok\\n@VerizonSupport Can\\'t connect to the internet. No outage reported in my area.\\n@VerizonSupport Red\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve been there, it tells me there is no outage in my area. Unfortunately I\\'m still having issues with internet.\\n@VerizonSupport I tried that already\\n@VerizonSupport When I login and try to go there it tells me \"You do not have permission to view this directory or page\"\\n@VerizonSupport Cell.  And just now somebody randomly changed a $20 credit to a $15 credit making my previously \"paid in full\" bill not paid. Glad I checked\\n@VerizonSupport Business DSL\\n@VerizonSupport It’s ok. You can’t help me either. It’s ok. Nothing major.\\n@VerizonSupport Followed won’t let me DM\\n@VerizonSupport You can have someone call me DM for number.\\n@VerizonSupport .@comcastcares and it looks like Fios is half the price you were quoting me for internet this morning (when we talked hours ago) AND they’re faster? 🤔\\n@VerizonSupport cellular\\n@VerizonSupport Waiting for page to load....\\n@VerizonSupport Virginia. We called and are supposed to get someone tomorrow\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular account\\n@VerizonSupport Your employee lied to me saying he set up auto-pay on my account. Of course he didn\\'t, so you sent me to collections.\\nYour supervisor says she can\\'t control if employees don\\'t explain things correctly. \\nYeah, it\\'s called proper training I believe.\\n@VerizonSupport I have questions about making changes to my services\\n@VerizonSupport no it\\'s your piece of shit phone service giving me 10 million sales calls.\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t want to make this a permanent arrangement, just wanted to make sure my service didn’t get disconnected.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you for the help....on an unrelated note, if I were to switch carries, what would happens with the remaining balance of my phone?\\n@VerizonSupport Cell service. This has happened too many times for me to count recently!\\n@VerizonSupport trying to connect my internet and cable and nothing is working. I’ve tried everything  and my virtual chat representative logged out midway.\\n@VerizonSupport They are\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport How do you reboot it?\\n@VerizonSupport That didn\\'t work\\n@VerizonSupport Not sure wife is asleep. Only channel though\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m in TN, they called my cell. Said I was overcharged by $25 (and some change) and I had to verify some things and I said they should know my name, etc. He tried to tell me his employee ID or something but ultimately hung up.\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile, hit the dms\\n@VerizonSupport yes!\\n@VerizonSupport I just told you I did all the usual troubleshooting and found nothing out of the ordinary\\n@VerizonSupport Know what I\\'m talking about. I wouldn\\'t be coming to you for answers if I didn\\'t find anything out of the ordinary after troubleshooting\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve already had someone over phone take a look and they told me the issues are happening on your side not mine, so once again no thank you\\n@VerizonSupport Looks like I do have another day. But no channels worked on any Fios television at all, so I will have to watch somewhere else.\\n@VerizonSupport Appreciate the effort but not worth trying to troubleshoot. Just going to look elsewhere. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. In yellow shirts. They tell me fios is installed, I say I\\'m not interested right now, and they come back every day. Sometimes twice.\\n@VerizonSupport Issues trying to set my wife up for LifeLock Select through Verizon, Verizon and Lifelock arguing all night over who\\'s responsibility it is.\\n@VerizonSupport No, your support personnel hung up on me.\\n@VerizonSupport Is that a question?\\n@VerizonSupport Lifelock 3 times, Verizon 5. Each time they say it\\'s the other\\'s responsibilty\\n@VerizonSupport LL can\\'t help because I pay Verizon, Verizon can\\'t help because it\\'s a LL account\\n@VerizonSupport This is people bootleg streams\\n@VerizonSupport i\\'m missing the football game because of this crapola\\n@VerizonSupport Well  after getting 404 Forbidden it is just sitting &amp; waiting for https://t.co/8ZpQjZUcr6 for several minutes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, now iPhone takes several minutes to connect to WiFi\\n@VerizonSupport Download 84.85 upload 93.19\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Just trying to use twitter\\n@VerizonSupport Tweets not loading, sometimes just text &amp; no pics or just the spinning reloading\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, iPhones &amp; iPad\\n@VerizonSupport I believe so yes\\n@VerizonSupport No just the on demand\\n@VerizonSupport I’m not getting a message, it doesn’t give the menu for on demand. It just keeps giving me movie previews.\\n@VerizonSupport Hi! From a wireless connection.\\n@VerizonSupport @745833 I have project that I\\'m working on and I can not complete it because no service. No call back from customer support. This is crazy\\n@VerizonSupport All services are down. No TV, phone and Internet.\\n@VerizonSupport It started during the storm on Sunday. I called immediately in the morning, was told it will be restored within 3hrs, but up till moment\\n@VerizonSupport I was told that I will get a call back from the customer support of I can not wait, I have not get any call back.\\n@VerizonSupport I only have internet.\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you. A rep will be out on Wednesday AM.\\n@VerizonSupport Already did earlier. I spent 15mins trying 2 fix it. Appreciate the tweet but it’s late in my part of the 🌎\\n@VerizonSupport Tried this am. App had me sign in, then shut down. Logged back in, everything was showing tried 2 play a show said it couldn’t connect\\n@VerizonSupport Not at the moment. Will try again when I am, if you all have another way to troubleshoot\\n@VerizonSupport Streaming issue Ran diagnostic 3x, said working, then shows disappeared off dvr area Closed out, logged back in, app froze, didn’t try again\\n@VerizonSupport Now system button blinking red\\n@VerizonSupport let\\'s see you are a robot. 3 calls and disconnect order #va11321913561 Total 1.5 hours wasted ... https://t.co/YnIFAwyiHb\\n@VerizonSupport Thank u very much\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Already did that and they are good.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Not to mention when I got back home and called them because the channels never showed up the support department is closed till tomorrow so there\\'s another day without service\\n@VerizonSupport They can\\'t get my service right. I\\'m supposed to have Starz Showtime HBO and Cinemax and I don\\'t have them they told me it would take an hour to reboot my television I leave the house for 2 hours I come back still no channels it\\'s one of the many things that are wrong\\n@VerizonSupport Supervisor promised to look into it and call back in 1 hour.  That was 2-1/2 hrs ago\\n@VerizonSupport I’m sure they’re there and I’ll check them out. Already wasn’t happy and I️t won’t get me that $30 back. We’ll see.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport No  it was still there, I can connect from my cell I just have verizon internet service. I don\\'t use the wifi cause it never seems to.connect\\n@VerizonSupport Ok\\n@VerizonSupport Md.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, still nothing I\\'ve done it several times. i am wondering if there\\'s an outage in the area\\n@VerizonSupport It just says \"no internet connection\" And no light where the laptop is plugged in. It doesn\\'t have lights that light up when you plug a device in the lights that let you know you are on and connected are the only lights that comes on.\\n@VerizonSupport No it\\'s just the Verizon Internet service\\n@VerizonSupport The yellow warning symbol that tells you when you are connected or not and yes it has been restarted several times\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it\\'s plugged in, everything was working fine earlier until tonight\\n@VerizonSupport All three and they are green\\n@VerizonSupport Wired\\n@VerizonSupport That’s where I was when I ran it. The router is within inches to only a few feet from me at all times\\n@VerizonSupport I’m not sure what the correct speeds would be? It is extremely slow trying to download anything.. an os update takes 12 hours sometimes.. and that’s if it doesn’t time out.\\n@VerizonSupport I’m not sure that I have any cables here to wire directly to the router. It took me 6 hours to download Microsoft office on a brand new Mac wirelessly though 😭\\n@VerizonSupport No it’s just on an empty desk. This is like the third one we have had. It works good for a little while and then quits and/or slows down so much\\n@VerizonSupport The customer representative who helped me was not helpful and blaming me ! The only mistake I did is trusting that store manager ! It’s my hard earned money which I was been cheated !\\n@VerizonSupport Yep\\n@VerizonSupport It has not been resolved. I told you all about the issue on Monday &amp; by DM &amp; you have yet to resolve it. It has not been a priority for you. Sending a message to @1649 w/out follow up is not helpful.\\n@VerizonSupport I couldn\\'t get to a person, just automated messages\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, Fire department confirmed line was cut\\n@VerizonSupport Will do in the morning.\\n@VerizonSupport The error is pixelation when we select a program to watch on VOD. There is no error message. It simply goes ahead and plays. Router was checked. My husband is getting frustrated; we can’t get billing relief for all this trouble and wants to pull Verizon plug.\\n@VerizonSupport Do you understand that we are beyond solving it on the one box where it is happening? The tardy tech replaced the box and left in a hurry with box not programmed to record. Now On Demand doesn’t work again. Phone tech solved problem for 7th time but we remain unhappy customers.\\n@VerizonSupport That’s a good question. We’ve been calling about this issue for months so there should be some kind of note on our account don’t you think?\\n@VerizonSupport Been there done that. Tech has been to house. New cable box. Don’t tell me to unplug and reset the box. We need an actual customer service person who cares about customers.\\n@VerizonSupport Residential.\\n@VerizonSupport Internet keeps losing service, tv does not. Reset basement usually gets it back for a couple hours/days before it goes out again. Globe goes red on router but WiFi still on without any internet.\\n@VerizonSupport Tried that last night. Didn’t help. Only thing that helped was resetting the basement ont\\n@VerizonSupport And yet again it only worked for a day after resetting and now I lost internet again. Is this an ont or router issue?\\n@VerizonSupport Usually. This time it has not yet started working again.\\n@VerizonSupport No. I had the router replaced a month or so ago because we kept losing internet. It is still not back.\\n@VerizonSupport Wasn’t aware that I had one. I’ve been on autopay at the same price since October 2015. The fact that I can get cheaper &amp; faster from @115900 is upsetting. Looking at the @115725 page I either pay increased price for same speed or pay less for faster but have $150 upgrade fee.\\n@VerizonSupport So you\\'re telling me to leave? I have no recourse, no discount or reason to stay? No deal that you have? Just \"sorry, your bundle ended\" ?\\n@VerizonSupport If you haven’t read the thread, here is the deal: I, the customer, am upset, attempted to address the issue, and am being told to go away.\\n@VerizonSupport I have already showed the specifics of the offers I have received from @115900 and what I was offered on the @115725 page.

Bad customer support, internet and overpriced\\n@VerizonSupport @755378 C’mon.... that is the standard. We’re always promised super-high speeds, but don’t actually get them.

Thx https://t.co/hXss0HRB6J\\n@VerizonSupport Give me a price\\n@VerizonSupport Y\\'all full of shit\\n@VerizonSupport My issue is that I pay THOUSANDS of dollars to @115725 every year, and get treated like garbage over and over. I know that\\'s not a lot of money to you, but to a public school teacher, it is. If you want, I can go into further detail, but it won\\'t fit here.\\n@VerizonSupport Hello?\\n@VerizonSupport Followed\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/RPN70iMdbp\\n@VerizonSupport No it’s just making like it was never purchased\\n@VerizonSupport Red\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for your assistance!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I do!

Thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport Cable is on just fine and other channels work. So it’s not the connection.\\n@VerizonSupport Looks like 11/16 and 11/17 at least. Have had the STB only a few days.\\n@VerizonSupport Just did! I unplugged and let it sit for ~30 seconds.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok! Done!\\n@VerizonSupport I try to use a saved credit card and it asks to enter a valid billing address and gives no place to enter it, despite having \"use the same as billing address\" checked.\\n@VerizonSupport Cell service, been working with customer support for going on 90 minutes now and all I have at this point is MORE problems\\n@VerizonSupport Forget it.  I spent over an hour on the phone with technical support, only to find out that I need a technician come, but none are available until Tuesday.  Totally and completely awful service.  Awful.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s struggling to load the test page unfortunately\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s no longer working on my mobile, a weak connection comes through occasionally but for the most part nothing is there. Currently no devices are able to load anything\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. We are unable to test because no devices will load up a browser. It says there is no connection.\\n@VerizonSupport All devices show that they are connected but we are not able to use internet on any of them currently\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m not sure. I do know our router and modem seem to be working fine and communicating with each other\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, two computers. Neither are able to load a browser\\n@VerizonSupport Amazon does support 1G, Eero also supports 1G...\\n@VerizonSupport Wired connection from Amazon TV to Quantum Gateway.  It’s been this way for a week when looking at my wired Eros\\n@VerizonSupport But commercials never lag, why is that?\\n@VerizonSupport D 27.9 U 26.4.  D 25.1 U 26.2  D 22.7 U 26.1\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve reset router many times in hopes something would change but it never does\\n@VerizonSupport I just reset it and restarted my computer and logged into nbc to stream and as soon as it loaded hit play 2 seconds .... freeze\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t know for sure if my TV was affected however my router wasn’t receiving an IP from you at all. Multiple reconnects with nothing and suddenly at 8:45 it got an IP almost like server maintenance.\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t have your router. I have a professional level router and there was physical connectivity but you were not providing an IP.\\n@VerizonSupport No that will cause a problem with your port security and take my internet down again. My router is connected via Ethernet to the ONT. You guys do MAC based authentication on your ONTs for non standard equipment.\\n@VerizonSupport I have it restored hunch my ability to tweet but I lost my IP at 7:53pm and it didn’t get restored until 8:45pm.  I see this happen frequently after 12am. Just want to know what is going on.\\n@VerizonSupport I have owned my phone for over a year, will i need to pay an extra fee to upgrade?\\n@VerizonSupport Only have one tv hooked up, just switched to Fios three weeks ago, pretty disappointed\\n@VerizonSupport it came back just now by itself. Just REALLY SLOW. Hope it gets fixed!\\n@VerizonSupport @115911 Interesting how @115911 replied within seconds but not a peep from @VerizonSupport\\n@VerizonSupport No. I’m watching SNF and the screen doesn’t stop flashing, any channel, even when the box is off. The verizon mesage symbol that rotates on the dead screen even flashes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it’s flashing everything\\n@VerizonSupport Excuse me? I’m supposed to fix everything and then pay you? Do your job @115722 check your logs, I’ve spent hours trying to get mediocre internet to work\\n@VerizonSupport No, it’s you’re terrible internet service. Can’t use my phone either unless I turn off WiFi\\n@VerizonSupport Your internet service is terrible. Have to use my cell data in my home, so I guess you’re awful at one and use the other to charge me extra #fail #verizonfail #dishonest\\n@VerizonSupport Well. It’s better but still glitchy\\n@VerizonSupport I can check the other tv tomorrow. Someone is sleeping in that room. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah im sorry i pay for this bs. Yo shit lag thats the issue!!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. (I’m sure you can’t help me with discounts at gamestop) lol\\n@VerizonSupport It’s now back ty\\n@VerizonSupport #cnn off air\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I just switched from AT&amp;T and have now had only 1-2 bars around Queens and Long Island, esp inside my house/buildings. Can’t always depend on WiFi.\\n@VerizonSupport im not getting my phone on time because you guys are incompetent. im switching to t mobile now\\n@VerizonSupport Avoid Verizon store on Sashabaw (Victra) CLARKSTON MI The staff working there will promise all kinds of discounts and activation fee credits after you get your first bill. LIES. You are warned. Verizon claims no authority over promises made at their retail stores.\\n@VerizonSupport No worries. If you won’t back your stores we will spread the word locally and shut them down through word of mouth.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. I added a line to my account from sprint.\\n@VerizonSupport Now it’s over the 45 days for trade in to qualify...\\n@VerizonSupport Sure I would love to explain it to another Verizon person to get nowhere...\\n@VerizonSupport Sent email on 11/13 regarding the refer a friend program. Was told you have to refer someone who gets the triple play but my email said double or triple play. Gave info in email regarding the person I referred and their install date. Was just trying to find out what’s going on\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it is from my Verizon cellular.  We r also checking with our land line provider @65395\\n@VerizonSupport Thank-you for your reply.  I was able to FINALLY get through.  There is/has been something wrong with the 2.4G connection.  Now, they are saying it is the extender. Time will tell.\\n@VerizonSupport This image is of my October bill. The discount is an employer one. Does not explain why I\\'m getting charged $20 more now. If there\\'s an expired discount of $20, let\\'s get it back on there. Thanks. https://t.co/QgESHu4YgQ\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless mobile. I’ve started following you so we can DM.\\n@VerizonSupport No. Everything looks normal as far as I can tell. I’ll try to reset it in a bit\\n@VerizonSupport Was an electrical issue in my apartment. Thx\\n@VerizonSupport Wired looks good 57 down 62 up\\n@VerizonSupport Some stay blank, with a black screen. Others say I\\'m not authorized. We know we are. We pay for it. Even mentioned to tighten the coax cable. Didn\\'t work\\n@VerizonSupport On the phone with CS now...\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Nothing. I couldn\\'t stay.

I provided all necessary info, what are your next steps?\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks! https://t.co/AxTfzqsgzJ\\n@VerizonSupport You guys don’t have #LA at all? No west coast cities?\\n@VerizonSupport How can you not have Los Angeles? We have to deal with Spectrum as a monopoly here, is that what you’re saying?\\n@VerizonSupport Do they work under that name here or use people?\\n@VerizonSupport They asked for account info including pin; claiming they could lower our bill. However they couldn’t even tell what current package we had. (Suspicious) Once asked to see their credentials, they immediately became defensive, rude and left. Do these ladies work for you?\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks. Are you able to see 1) if the account was accessed internally at this time, and 2) which employee accessed it? I’m concerned for the account security since we have them our pin and other info\\n@VerizonSupport So since we didn’t make any changes and didn’t get and email we should be okay?\\n@VerizonSupport I have DSL with one of your modems. Wifi is good, internet drops intermittently\\n@VerizonSupport no. Just the new D-Link modem that Vz sent that was supposed to fix the problem\\n@VerizonSupport no. The Helpdesk always told me their change would fix it\\n@VerizonSupport  how can I get to a higher level Helpdesk for internet support? The first level Helpdesk is not solving the problem\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless mobile service. She even hang up on me.\\n@VerizonSupport Please reference order # RI00347820375 then phone me at the number on the order.\\n@VerizonSupport It’s over I’m down with Verizon and I’m never coming back to your service #OptimumOnline is better!\\n@VerizonSupport So no matter when you cancel Verizon still gets a check! Never in my life have I seen a company do that...so yeah\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s so effing slow. It\\'s always slow but today is especially bad. It\\'s so expensive and so bad.\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t know what that means. I have broadband.\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless. It\\'s 2017 though.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope\\n@VerizonSupport Ding ding ding...... We have a winner!\\n@VerizonSupport No I am not\\n@VerizonSupport Nope, sure don\\'t.\\n@VerizonSupport Target\\n@VerizonSupport Hmm, that link says build your phone plan, I\\'m looking for fios internet. It wants me to sign up for notify list when fios will be in area\\n@VerizonSupport They weren\\'t able to answer any questions... just claimed that FIOS is not offered where I am. Is this supposed rep scamming me?\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t, as I haven\\'t moved in yet. The apt bldg gave me contact info for verizon rep that claims there\\'s 50/50 fios.\\n@VerizonSupport NY00348633604\\n@VerizonSupport Techs visited my site Friday and Today and told me there is a nation wide outage and nothing they can do.  Called Verizon Repair and they keep telling me there is no such outage.  I am a business who relies on my fax and no one can give me a straight answer after 4 days.\\n@VerizonSupport I provided you with ticket number of issue. I have been \"on\" with verizon since like 930am with no resolution. Define help? Again, it is simple the tech messed up, tech needs to return to fix problem.\\n@VerizonSupport Appreciate the quick reply. Working with Live Chat now. Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks. I cannot see the link.\\n@VerizonSupport @767946 Mobile\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. The conduit and pulls were there - Verizon told me they didn\\'t want to engineer it. 3 months later Verizon wired the building for another suite. Took them 1 day to wire the other suite. I never wanted to leave Verizon - they told me to call Comcast.\\n@VerizonSupport My secretary has called twice. Both times told there was nothing they could do.\\nWhen we originally tried to get the transfer I was told that there would be no termination fee because they chose not to transfer. I should have asked for it in writing.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ll call in the morning. Thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you.\\n@VerizonSupport mobile\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I did that and it says all I can get is 300mb in my area why is that I can\\'t pick 1gb\\n@VerizonSupport That page doesn\\'t tell me anything what or where am I supposed to be looking?\\n@VerizonSupport No, you can\\'t. You\\'ll just end up telling me to call. That\\'s part of the problem. Chat people aren\\'t empowered to change a pending FIOS order.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\\n@VerizonSupport So, do it myself.  Got it. Awesome.\\n@VerizonSupport I worked with the online rep and almost canceled my service, so I think I’ll just stay with what I have\\n@VerizonSupport The account is mobile. My original issue was with logging into My Verizon.\\n@VerizonSupport I do\\n@VerizonSupport Just finished! All fixed. Thanks 😎👌\\n@VerizonSupport Both! You keep sending me texts saying I need to schedule an appointment to fix my service, but I had an appointment last week and my service is working fine! Now I\\'m getting texts saying you\\'re going to cancel my service - for no reason!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I disconnected the power and all the lights went out\\n@VerizonSupport No, but video went red\\n@VerizonSupport Doesn\\'t work. I went outside to check the wires and I found the problem. The wires were cut and are down. So what do I do about that\\n@VerizonSupport None of them are lit up except for PWR,BAT, and POTS is blinking green\\n@VerizonSupport google  chrome\\n@VerizonSupport so why when i gave my account number it asked me gain for it but with -s\\n@VerizonSupport tried it but it was to picky . is it a live person or a computer\\n@VerizonSupport trying to review my account but not liking how page is set up. i click on whats included in packages but its blank\\n@VerizonSupport the site is alittle confusing\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, same network, same device.\\n@VerizonSupport Super slow and I’m paying for the fastest service Verizon supplies\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, that is what someone else told me already. What is the next step since the tech failed to do that? I\\'m sitting at home burning up all my data running a hot spot just to post my Quarter 1 grades?\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks Jay. Any update on a possible timeline for getting back online? Always happy to save a few bucks, but would be happier to have my internet. 😊\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for taking the time to look into this. Looking forward to re-entering the Information Age by 1 o\\'clock tomorrow.\\n@VerizonSupport Last # I got was MDHM0317FY. At one point today I was told it was closed...\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s what the text support on the phone said. Nov 27th. They\\'re \"changing a line\". This is one office in a building in midtown Manhattan. Smells fishy to me. Unlikely that an entire building at least would be our. Unlikely that Verizon leaves it out for one week.\\n@VerizonSupport Any update on this yet? Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport Just about her service I\\'m not sure exactly.\\n@VerizonSupport Turned router off then back on (one minute). Then turned cable box off then back on (one minute). All previously mentioned problems still there.\\n@VerizonSupport I already turned it on then back on. How do I reboot the cable box?\\n@VerizonSupport I work for Oath. Where would I find the discount for Verizon/Oath employees?\\n@VerizonSupport Thanx, a chat rep is sorting it out!\\n@VerizonSupport That is what I was trying. Crossing my fingers\\n@VerizonSupport I cannot log on to pay a bill. No one can fix it for the last 4 months. Over it.

I can reboot everything too. https://t.co/qXQPjO6oSa\\n@VerizonSupport fios router &gt; Ethernet &gt; google wifi device.

The site showed on thing when I placed the order but I received something different.\\n@VerizonSupport Fios\\n@VerizonSupport Nothing changed. The globe is still red and the internet below is white. Didn’t even see the router change at all\\n@VerizonSupport Small black box on wall with reset button and plug into outlet\\n@VerizonSupport Not unless extreme pressure is applied. Rather uncomfortable having button imprints in my fingertips.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, 2 boxes in the house. Both have the same issue. Buttons failing to make contact on the circuit, it seems.\\n@VerizonSupport ...okay. Message sent, hoping for resolution.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, you did. I didn\\'t want to go into account review, just yet. I want to know for certain if vzn charges for replacing defective equipmemt before I go any further.\\n@VerizonSupport There\\'s two possibilities: either charging to replace defective equipment or standing by your service and products by replacing defective equipment as a courtesy to your subscribed customer.\\n@VerizonSupport One time per box? I\\'ll take a look, now.\\n@VerizonSupport Negative. I\\'ve mentioned they\\'ve been troublesome for a long time but 3 months is a hardly a warranty for a TV remote. https://t.co/j5c7yEmI3W\\n@VerizonSupport Do us a favor, @VerizonSupport and alert your customers of this great deal RCA RCRPS06GR 6 Device Universal Remote https://t.co/FkO3Qlq8Lg. Lifetime warranty, universal, and cheaper thanyour option. Gauging by the reviews, a more reliable option, too.\\n@VerizonSupport Rn it\\'s just network speeds.

Google\\'s 0.28 down / 89.0 up.  https://t.co/ta2vyXvkny is 5.38 down / 91.09 up.  The download speed is def wrong.\\n@VerizonSupport Yep.\\n@VerizonSupport Not really. And my settings weren\\'t an issue before. Nothing has changed except my download speed.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m not using a Verizon router. Also that shouldn\\'t be necessary as this has happened before and usually all you have to do is reset my network from your end.\\n@VerizonSupport I’m (not) connecting to my home WiFi that I pay for each month\\n@VerizonSupport Fios\\n@VerizonSupport exactly 49 minutes and counting of simply trying to add custom tv and it won\\'t check me out.\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s my home service\\n@VerizonSupport I have been trying to get my services restored since 430pm.

My order NJ11321351295\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, have for past 3 years\\n@VerizonSupport All the fios routers autoselect 6 and interfere with each other.  This is not an all the time thing.  It works for days than cuts off, necessitating the reboot and resumes working for another few days\\n@VerizonSupport All the Xfinity routers are on 1 😒\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, it\\'s on 12.  Every other FiOS router in area is on 6. Network is visible to all devices, but connection is dropped and cannot be re-established without a router reboot. A Google search reveals many quantum router owners have this problem\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. Never. Ran a wifi analyser and set the channel clear of interference from neighborhood APs. 2.4 GHz network goes down once a week, 5GHz network is unaffected.  Have to reboot router to regain 2.4 network\\n@VerizonSupport No, only and always my Android. I am looking into Xfinity mobile as I have triple play, $70 p/month with new IPhone. Not sure you can offer me better deal?\\n@VerizonSupport #Rediculous!!\\n@VerizonSupport Started this process in September!! My husband has worked for the same company for years...

Just tried. Today try for 2 of an installation appt. No show again.\\n@VerizonSupport Just replied to this. Seriously?\\n@VerizonSupport I’ll wait for you guys to call me. I’m  tired of waiting and answering 1001 automated questions. Acct # __credit_card__\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, they sent me on a endless loop of holds and then disconnected me.\\n@VerizonSupport I have been having issues with Verizon since August!  way too much to type please find me in your system and have someone call me on my cell which is listed!\\n@VerizonSupport Nah dawg, I’m hurt...y’all hurt my feelings, I’m out\\n@VerizonSupport Mannnnnnn y’all charged me for services I’m not using. IM HURT MAN\\n@VerizonSupport Landline\\n@VerizonSupport A check has been mailed to 221 W, MANHATTAN, NY-10011 and you should receive it within the next 2 weeks. (NOT MY FULL ADDRESS)\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless. My entire area is out. Fort Eustis Virginia.\\n@VerizonSupport Will do when I get home. Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport I received an onscreen message saying that my Fios was not working and channel is unavailable\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m. at work right now and I woke up this morning with no internet or phone or cable so I can only contact you at work\\n@VerizonSupport Its upgrading fios for our entire apartment, so nothing to help there. Although within the last month or so our cellphone service has been terribly subpar. Suddenly I get little to no reception at our apartment making calls terrible quality on both ends.\\n@VerizonSupport Trust me; Im already setup on your email alert list the moment it\\'s available. I already have Fios at work, and my parents\\' house. Howard Beach, NY waits patiently for Fios to overtake @Ask_Spectrum. They are terrible.\\n@VerizonSupport wasn\\'t visible when he came by...seemed like a person who was just trying to get our personal info b/c of that, should definitely have some material to make them seem official.\\n@VerizonSupport The support even answered faster! Phew making a good pitch without having to make a pitch\\n@VerizonSupport I do not\\n@VerizonSupport It’s my roommates router.\\n@VerizonSupport It’s soo slow!\\n@VerizonSupport I thought my internet service was slow but this is worse. Will be time to consider Xfinity\\n@VerizonSupport Signing in fine on the site, but when I use the same info on the sign-in on the Fox Sports Go app, it\\'s telling me the info is wrong.\\n@VerizonSupport Static in my ear waiting on hold, Verizon Support Bot.\\n@VerizonSupport Not even the issue, because I don\\'t use your service currently. Static on hold with you, again, but no static when I\\'m chatting with somebody. You might want to fix that. Apologies: \"nigh constant static\" in the original tweet.\\n@VerizonSupport But it has the downfall of having to over pay for the equipment lol\\n\\nAlso when I signed up with you guys, the rep I spoke to told me that when Ive paid enough to cover the cost of buying the router, you would give me a call &amp; talk about whether I wanted to keep it or keep renting\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s not what I want though. The rep I spoke to when I signed up told me that after I had paid enough to cover the cost, I would have the option to keep it without having to pay more money.\\n@VerizonSupport So the rep I spoke to when I signed up lied to me?\\n@VerizonSupport Ok it’s back on and still no internet :/\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t have that. Is that fios? I have dsl...\\n@VerizonSupport Yup\\n@VerizonSupport It’s all devices and it switches from going so slow that it hangs or just out and out telling me it can’t connect to anything on the internet\\n@VerizonSupport It’s green\\n@VerizonSupport If you can send instructions how I can try\\n@VerizonSupport My bill was raised and was told it was because your company had an audit. My rate was suppose to be guaranteed through 2019\\n@VerizonSupport How do I do that?\\n@VerizonSupport Another error message.

I touched the wps button.\\n@VerizonSupport No clue\\n@VerizonSupport No internet service at all.\\n@VerizonSupport Only tv that I notice\\n@VerizonSupport Samsung tv\\n@VerizonSupport Interface = Clunky\\n\\nYou\\'re better than this...\\nIt\\'s a steaming culture. Rarely are people watching live TV. Make it all content based.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular, a lot the the time I have no service\\n@VerizonSupport Can we talk in the DMs?\\n@VerizonSupport DSL unfortunately, very inconsistent connection. And even when it is working, it\\'s pitiful to pay that much for a connection that never even reaches 3Mbs.\\n@VerizonSupport Please follow me back so we can DM.\\n@VerizonSupport ok\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless. I finally got to the \"Pay my bill\" section, but it can\\'t tell me what I owe. It says I owe $0 which I know is not correct.\\n@VerizonSupport I️ just followed but can’t DM\\n@VerizonSupport All I️ want is new boxes for my TVs. The boxes they installed are huge I️ want small boxes\\n@VerizonSupport This doesn\\'t take me to an outages page.\\n@VerizonSupport I have static on my phone line.\\n@VerizonSupport You mean just unplugging it?\\n@VerizonSupport Alarm silence. No ONT reset.\\n@VerizonSupport I held the alarm silence button in for 20 seconds. Didn’t do anything.\\n@VerizonSupport So this means I’m stuck with the static.\\n@VerizonSupport no I am a employee at tmobile I am the one who put the warrant out. law enforcement told me to use every forum to get Verizon attention on the criminal activity. I will be alerting the authority with the bakery square location he works as well as all documentation tomorrow mornin\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile! Just wanted to know when I should be expecting my delivery if something was overnighted yesterday was all.\\n@VerizonSupport Have been doing this all night on the phone with an agent. Not helping. Still waiting for a technician to come out. #manhattandeadzone\\n@VerizonSupport Just hung up with a very helpful rep\\n@VerizonSupport dm me\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s happening with USA, it doesn\\'t look like other channels are doing it. I only know it\\'s behind because I\\'m recording Smackdown which is on now but Modern Family is what it\\'s playing on \"live tv\"\\n@VerizonSupport Ok as I started calling you, it starts to work. Literally did nothing to make it work! So strange.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes! Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport That didn’t work\\n@VerizonSupport Found it. Battery button is not lit. Only the system status button is lit\\n@VerizonSupport Currently don\\'t have access to that 😩\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/g6KkrFYcIB\\n@VerizonSupport Chat for an hour, finally have supervisor admit I’m correct, get “disconnected”\\n@VerizonSupport Have received this message literally 25 times in a row... I counted https://t.co/Df3IC2rJhW\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/7nZuzXpuma\\n@VerizonSupport My concerns WERENT ADDRESSED. He said he was working on it and we got “disconnected”.

Can’t find it\\n@VerizonSupport My sister fixed I️t. Sorry for being dramatic\\n@VerizonSupport White unit.  Dont recall light on bbu\\n@VerizonSupport It beeped all lights came on. System light did not go off.\\n@VerizonSupport Rebooted. Screen message -set top box has no connectivity\\n@VerizonSupport Found it\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, but could it be an outage around my area?\\n@VerizonSupport On phones it says \"internet may not be available\" as soon as it connects to the router.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes they are both able to connect\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it does connect to wireless devices but does not get internet connection\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t have any wired connections only wireless and I don\\'t have TV services with Verizon, so I can\\'t test that\\n@VerizonSupport Yes but only for a bit, when I reboot the router it goes from red to white\\n@VerizonSupport It sure is on both tv’s. Not every channel. I don’t really want to go through every last one and check. I do see it’s retroplex and indieplex. https://t.co/WrCStzJ4Kj\\n@VerizonSupport As far as we can tell it’s good and tight. What else can we look at?\\n@VerizonSupport No its your shitty software freezing and crashing, you should be paying us to have this garbage in our house\\n@VerizonSupport You did nothing. I started stopping the dvr when programs were starting and rebooted periodically. The dvr drive is aging but you dont move recorded programs so changing dvrs destroy all our recorded programs\\n@VerizonSupport Yes! Thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport Got it! Had to re plug in the HDMI\\n@VerizonSupport Only one of our TVs is affected- not sure why\\n@VerizonSupport Received the chat link 40 minutes ago, still no help. #comeonguys\\n@VerizonSupport Can you at least tell me if it\\'s a system wide issue in my area?  It\\'s been over half an hour.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes i am i don’t get why my service is being shitty and i got Verizon\\n@VerizonSupport What do u mean\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve on the phone an hour trying to have them make corrections to my November bill and give me my promotions back so my bill can go back to the previous promotion i had. They keep giving me the run around and putting me on hold. I just want to pay my $202\\n@VerizonSupport Board in basement is blinking red under Moca\\n@VerizonSupport No just internet\\n@VerizonSupport They were white , then I restarted , now red\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you!!! It worked.\\n@VerizonSupport I wanted to watch on my computer.  FIOS directions say to login but every time I select \"live TV\" it logs me out again and won\\'t let me select NBC to watch Steelers Game - a channel I get on my TV\\nCause @VerizonSupport claimed it would be fixed on Nov 20 and it def wasn\\'t working when I left on the 21st\\n@VerizonSupport You don\\'t know? Did they fix shit or nah?\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport Yes the two wants to charge us $150 to upgrade\\n@VerizonSupport Terrible service all over New Mexico\\n@VerizonSupport @115722 Red light. No internet or landline. tv is fine. We checked all connections and restarted everything.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Talked w technical support after 58 minutes of holding. They said there is an outage in my area. There should probably be an efficient way to let your customers know about this stuff...\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. I checked it twice before I called. And after a while of this, it becomes completely useless. https://t.co/7kokJMBLiG\\n@VerizonSupport Tried again. It says there are no service outages in my area. Contrary to what technical support said. Zip code is 19145. What is happening?? Will my service be restored soon??\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. On the phone. After, again, 58 minutes of holding. He said there was an outage in my area. Your website says there is not. Please tell me which is correct. Zip code 19145.\\n@VerizonSupport Sure, so, there should be a better way to let your customers know of outages than websites that aren\\'t accessible and/or accurate. That\\'s all I\\'ve been saying.\\n@VerizonSupport Will do right away, thank you for being so speedy with your response\\n@VerizonSupport Its green\\n@VerizonSupport Yea, tried that too.\\n@VerizonSupport Yea multiple occasions before the tweet.\\n@VerizonSupport Red &amp; White https://t.co/R9GMSpayDT\\n@VerizonSupport Home, Everything was working fine five minutes ago then the wifi said \"Connected, No Internet\"\\n@VerizonSupport No you can’t. You’re supposed support help made it worse. All this for $500/month what a deal\\n@VerizonSupport I was told that I could not use my own router, that’s why I’ve been paying a monthly fee to use the one Verizon provided. Please connect me with a manager, I’ve been a customer for years now and this is not a reasonable resolution.\\n@VerizonSupport What is a possible explanation for why our router to device speeds was excellent right when we connected the service and now it’s awful? 5G band also cannot ever be connected to and shows the following error, I’ve manually set it to every channel and auto https://t.co/91yON0e2Zk\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, it’s the same. I’ve reset the password, reset the router, forgotten the network, and restarted phones and computers. All devices show the same issue.\\n@VerizonSupport I have many times but I will try again. Light on the Verizon box says “Replace Battery”, could that affect anything or is it just for power outage backup?\\n@VerizonSupport Please read above thread - no devices in the house have an Ethernet Port\\n@VerizonSupport The bottom image in that picture shows it. Connection to the router is good but the WiFi signal is terrible to all devices\\n@VerizonSupport I do not have any devices with an Ethernet port anymore. I’ve gone through all of this before - manually setting the connection Channel frequencies, resetting the router, etc. No improvement https://t.co/vX3dJbz0ry\\n@VerizonSupport Still no service. Same lights are solid green. Nothing lit on WAN\\n@VerizonSupport Is it supposed to make a noise when it resets? If so,there was no noise\\n@VerizonSupport Also on here the fail status light is a solid red https://t.co/0fgZ5UPqJg\\n@VerizonSupport The only ones lit are power,lan coax and wireless. All solid green\\n@VerizonSupport If it is not restored what should I do\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. Not lit at all\\n@VerizonSupport No thank you\\n@VerizonSupport Ive already answered both of tthose questions @115722\\n@VerizonSupport No... I currently have no service and an error message labeled APOO on my box.\\n@VerizonSupport No... And I was on the phone with the last tech for over an hour\\n@VerizonSupport Ive already spoken with 2 techs... Both lost service with me... Neither called me back... I think someone is comming to my house tomorrow after 9am but I have no confirmation and am not calling again.\\n@VerizonSupport Cant i just reprogram this one to work? Its 4 tvs and everyone is sleep i cant check other remotes\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport It doesnt power the tv on/off or chane the volume\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for the quick response. I don\\'t know what was wrong (no internet, red globe on the modem), but it just fixed itself.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I was looking at getting a pixel xl for cyber Monday deals but not positive if it will be the right phone for me\\n@VerizonSupport WAN Ethernet is not lit\\n@VerizonSupport Yes and no internet light is on\\n@VerizonSupport This started last night and it was the first thing done\\n@VerizonSupport So how do I do this? The battery box cover is screwed in. Do I take apart?\\n@VerizonSupport I see the coax cable\\n@VerizonSupport No\\n@VerizonSupport All green\\n@VerizonSupport no you cant I tried saturday to talk with you\\n@VerizonSupport omg why cant a rep just pivk up with out all this vomputer bs\\n@VerizonSupport no time for this..things to do..one reason im leaving verizon\\n@VerizonSupport now my cell phone battery almost dead.. its for my home\\n@VerizonSupport why bother they shutting us off today\\n@VerizonSupport for my fios tv and internet\\n@VerizonSupport Everything is fine now, as far as I know. I\\'m still wondering what went on with that first call?\\n@VerizonSupport How was your Holidays season going for you ^CAR\\n@VerizonSupport Great as always ^CAR\\n@VerizonSupport @125004 How are you been ^CAR 😀\\n@VerizonSupport Nope, my sister called again to see whats up because theyre saying the wifi is working but it clearly isn\\'t, now they are saying nobody\\'s available to come today, they also said they\\'d come this past saturday\\n@VerizonSupport Yup but the point is my sister\\'s missed two days of work waiting for a Tech and they just don\\'t show up, she\\'s got bills to pay\\n@VerizonSupport Yes,  0 devices will connect, the wifi doesn\\'t even show up\\n@VerizonSupport okay. well i look forward to your complete and timely cooperation tonight\\n@VerizonSupport we can work out an exchange\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular.\\n@VerizonSupport Basically, I have had a 5$ modem rental charge on there for over a year now.  I returned that modem when I returned all the tv boxes, but somehow that got lost.  I have contacted several times over the past year about this.\\n@VerizonSupport Wait a second, there are no contracts with Spectrum / Brighthouse\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah I think that was recent right no contracts?\\n@VerizonSupport I would like you to give me a free month for Cyber Monday, please. Thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport No everything. Wife called support and they have to send a tech but want to charge us possibly. Do u have any other ideas?\\n@VerizonSupport You refuse to give me a battery so there is nothing there.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok, thanks so much.\\n@VerizonSupport They\\'re supposed to install a phone jack so we can get internet. Ready to just cancel the whole thing and report you to the BBB\\n@VerizonSupport yes.\\n@VerizonSupport This is the hard wired result but it’s in no way running at that speed. https://t.co/XOMmulobe4\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Repeatedly.\\n@VerizonSupport Nothing. I have been a triple play customer for years. Special deals are always for new customers.\\n@VerizonSupport What about current customers?\\n@VerizonSupport Hi I can\\'t dm you?\\n@VerizonSupport Just was looking to see if I can get that internet package changed from the one I had! The 39.99 one\\n@VerizonSupport wireless\\n@VerizonSupport Unfair considering business we give Verizon....and our cell phones\\n@VerizonSupport You just said they could be used as universal remotes.   I\\'m not using my cell phone.   That can\\'t be easier than a real remote.   You want me to spend 40 bucks to watch TV.  That is awful.   Your service is over priced already and to nickel and dime customers is wrong.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m already following you.\\n@VerizonSupport I already did.\\n@VerizonSupport ...power buttons work sporadically.  You have to press very hard to put on.    Also navigating on demand is a problem.   The new screen layout is not designed well.   Takes 20 minutes to move around movie options.\\n@VerizonSupport Wow you are so goddamn unhelpful. Send a rep!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t know if you appreciate the damage this kind of shabby service actually inflicts on your customers. I\\'m asking for a rep, but inevitably you\\'re going to make this as painful as possible.\\n@VerizonSupport You didn\\'t send me a link and if you do send me one that says \"no outages reported\" you\\'re just wasting my time anyway\\n@VerizonSupport Send a rep. I\\'m paying for this service that you\\'re not providing. All correspondence is being forwarded to the FCC. All this nonsense to get you to send a goddamn rep. So just do it??\\n@VerizonSupport 2\\n@VerizonSupport I refuse to pay ...what 15 for each remote...pay a lot for our triple play with all channels...it\\'s crazy.....\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah it was\\n@VerizonSupport For my Verizon bill that your chat rep gave me pricing on and that I got charged $80 more and your “supervisor” couldn’t find the chat\\n@VerizonSupport No! Why should  I? 🙄✋️\\n@VerizonSupport I can change my granfathered rate to a smaller calling area, but that would lose my grandfatherd package with CID and CW, so by adding those individually I would be right back to where I am now - less service for the same money\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s terrible. Does your company not understand that for $25 a month we can get something like AT&amp;T Home Phone service that\\'s unlimited nationwide with all the bells &amp; whistles? Why pay $60+ to you for what others charge less for. Makes no sense\\n@VerizonSupport I just got off the phone with your 800-number. Are you able to do things that those people are unable to do?\\n@VerizonSupport What\\'s happening?\\n@VerizonSupport Your customer service person disappeared...???\\n@VerizonSupport Please Direct message me\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular.  I’ve opened a fraud case however it takes too long to reach a person and your service reps are rude.  Very long process to address something I️ didn’t do.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah if I\\'m going to pay $80+/month might as well get tv too\\n@VerizonSupport How soon can you be here?\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless. I have account number.\\n@VerizonSupport 2 of 3 still not working thanks to VZ\\n@VerizonSupport 😂 Obviously from a different number, Thank you for the reply!\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. Just this one. I’ve even double checked the old episodes. “Research,” you know.\\n@VerizonSupport I have. 😔\\n@VerizonSupport It’s the same on all of the TVs. I’ve tried all three.\\n@VerizonSupport Full, I used the app instead it worked finally\\n@VerizonSupport Read your DMs. Ongoing issue.\\n@VerizonSupport Then let me ask a question. If I am beyond my 2yr contract...been a customer for 5 and you no longer offer 50/50 on your website but you do offer 100/100 for 40$, why am still being billed for 50/50 at 56$\\n@VerizonSupport I waited 3 hours for the callback, when I answered it said press 1 to connect to the rep, I did..the rep connected and hung up before I said a word. So I tried online. You cannot cancel services, only upgrade or change.  The person in the chat also said they are not authorised...\\n@VerizonSupport Your internet sucks, I know many people fed up with how slow it is from different areas. You guys need to figure it out please.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah I need HELP ASAP\\n@VerizonSupport Sure. Waive the early termination/cancellation fee for the phone line. I\\'m currently paying $100.99+tax/etc for phone &amp; 25/25 Internet. Let me drop the phone line and pay you full price of $99.99 for 75/75 Internet. That\\'s all I wanted to do...11 year customer!\\n@VerizonSupport Yep since 2006\\n@VerizonSupport Great! I\\'ll go look up the number. Then I\\'ll call in, wait, be transferred, wait, then get told that my contract auto renewed. I\\'ll be told I have the following options:\\n1) Cancel now + pay ETF $426.18\\n2) Wait it out + remember to cancel in June 2019 or be auto renewed again\\n...\\n@VerizonSupport ...And I\\'ll say I get why there is a early cancelation fee within the first 2 years because there is promotional pricing, set up, etc. but I don\\'t get why there are early termination fees after the first contract period except to trap customers in contracts...\\n@VerizonSupport yep it’s looking like it’s working. Thanks for the help!\\n@VerizonSupport yep!\\n@VerizonSupport You think dell would still support a 755? With a q6600 processor?\\n@VerizonSupport Been on hold on a Verizon Store using your locations phone.\\nWhat\\'s the excuse? https://t.co/KF9G3MVMdg\\n@VerizonSupport Telesales.\\nI\\'d like to report a telesales person.\\nUnprofessional and I believe my info is in Jeopardy.\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t have any wired connections...everything is wireless\\n@VerizonSupport I was just online with the rep and instead she wait until I call the person I’m transferring it over to she hung up . Like this is what im talking about I’ll try again tomorrow but if i am not satisfied I’m canceling everything I have with you guys your customer service sucks\\n@VerizonSupport Rebooted 3x, it revived---all modem lights dark except power until the last round. Seems to be staying up now\\n@VerizonSupport It went blank right @220734 ?\\n@VerizonSupport All\\n@VerizonSupport They\\'re fine. I just had FiOS installed.

Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport Apparently the phone reps couldn’t actually help https://t.co/iykrzaXan4\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s to everything and at random times. It can last for a couple of hours or a couple of days. Right now it seems to have subsided from where it was when I initially tweeted, so doing a tracert isn\\'t showing anything unusual. Ping shows some random delay getting to Google https://t.co/JV04H9IYBZ\\n@VerizonSupport Here are tracert to Google, Yahoo and AWS https://t.co/qgMgnpqsEX\\n@VerizonSupport No, it doesn\\'t. I said it subsided for today in an earlier tweet but you guys wanted a tracert to narrow down an issue that\\'s currently not showing up...\\n@VerizonSupport Will do\\n@VerizonSupport Here\\'s the issue represented in graph form. Downloading a movie from Amazon Prime, Discord voice connection, YouTube video network activity and your requested tracert https://t.co/zuvjDIlrJV\\n@VerizonSupport Ok... So what does this mean?\\n@VerizonSupport I still don\\'t understand what you\\'re saying. You mean that I should not be having the problem I\\'m having then... why am I having it in the first place?

It was originally set for auto pay so it automatically took it out of our account even though that account was canceled 11/18. We also got the bill for our new account today.\\n@VerizonSupport Fios.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. All day long, in fact.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes! Can\\'t get amazon video or Netflix working at all, says there is also low speed.

The box also makes a weird sound\\n@VerizonSupport We don’t that happens day &amp; night ^^\\n@VerizonSupport I thinking of giving @116021 the pink slip. What can fios offer?\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'d like to get off hold and talk to a service representative\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular service\\n@VerizonSupport I put an order in last night, an iPad, to get the $250 off deal. Today my credit card company decided to say it\\'s fraud\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I have, it’s roughly the same. I’ve changed router/modems twice. Still the same had 3 technicians. Still the same. Why am I still only getting half of a megabit per second?\\n@VerizonSupport No, I have work in 4 hours. I’ll call you guys. Tomorrow. I’m tired of running the same preliminary tests twice a month for you to tell me to call any way.\\n@VerizonSupport DSL. I’ve dealt with this issue for over a year now. I’ve had multiple service calls and still I can’t load a video with your service.\\n@VerizonSupport Fios\\n@VerizonSupport Online thru a chat rep\\n@VerizonSupport It should have given my monthly estimate. Never received. It\\n@VerizonSupport You\\'re guys in store have lied repeatedly, choosing me over $200.... I tried to work this out online and on the phone with a big shoulder shrug being all I get\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s your network extender\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/AUbT8RtCYc\\n@VerizonSupport Blue\\n@VerizonSupport @115725 @VerizonSupport hello can you help?\\n@VerizonSupport Installed Saturday, issue reported Saturday, response came via voicemail that said 7-10 business days...the Twitter response time is impeccable though in comparison\\n@VerizonSupport We were told 7-10 business days\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve made a relatively simple request. May I have a phone number to speak with a live human, please? At this hour, when I have time?\\n@VerizonSupport Bot.\\nSend me the number of the rebate support line that hasn\\'t been disconnected, please. https://t.co/s9RqY2G844\\n@VerizonSupport How about the next time I dial customer service, and press 0 when none of your other options satisfy, either I get connected to a human, or the courtesy of an After-Hours front end message? Odd that a major service provider wouldn\\'t have agents available on the customer\\'s hours.\\n@VerizonSupport I cld and was told it’s random unwanted channel switch no reason and I’d have to pay $10 more to upgrade to get all 3 #bogus\\n@VerizonSupport both WAN and LAN lights are on in the back, only the circlular symbol in the front of the router is red. the wifi symbol is still lit up white\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, the \"replace battery\" is red, \"battery power\" is lit off, \"system status\" is green, and \"aux power source\" is lit off\\n@VerizonSupport \"Battery power\" light is off and \"replace battery\" is lit red\\n@VerizonSupport Nope, it did reboot but the lights are still red. Does the battery life affect the internet being *red*? I\\'m gonna call tomorrow to ask more specific questions\\n@VerizonSupport Hmmm after the reboot it started working again for some reason! Thank you! The light on my router isn\\'t red anymore. Is it possible to DM questions tomorrow regarding changing the battery of the RAM and other things?\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I\\'ve pressed the \"reset\" button which is red, it blinks for a minute and the internet symbol goes back to red\\n@VerizonSupport Ya my routers wifi symbol is on and I\\'m connected to wifi but the internet symbol is red and internet won\\'t load?\\n@VerizonSupport It won’t turn on\\n@VerizonSupport The tv itself, it looks a bit weird\\n@VerizonSupport Do you guys want a picture of what it looks like\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/wCJ6N0Tls9\\n@VerizonSupport So I can’t fix it?\\n@VerizonSupport My birthday is just two days from now on 11/30/2017 ^KMG :)\\n@VerizonSupport Ok.

Thinking of making the switch still.\\n@VerizonSupport This is on a mobile phone... However the internet is out completely ☹️. In our home and our neighbors\\' homes.\\n@VerizonSupport That link leads to a bad site.  Is this the kind of service I can expect from Verizon?  Not a good look...Pls re send\\n@VerizonSupport This issue has been ongoing since August. Who has time to spend hours on the phone only to be lied to?\\n@VerizonSupport Just called the number you gave. Phone system redirected to the usual system with \"higher call volume delays\" etc. Horrible\\n@VerizonSupport Please read this correctly. I dialed the number you gave me and it redirects to the usual place. Wait times over one hour.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. Transfers to the \"automated system that can help you with that\".\\n@VerizonSupport Checked it out... No outages in areas.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes!\\n@VerizonSupport Residential. It\\'s ridiculous that I have a small PowerPoint downloading and NOTHING else connected and it says it\\'s taking 3 hours and keeps stopping.\\n@VerizonSupport I did that twice\\n@VerizonSupport I paid my bill last week, received a text that I was past due, was sternly advised to resubmit the payment (and that I would not be double charged), then today I was charged 2x for the month. Billing reps were very rude and did not want to hear my concerns.\\n@VerizonSupport yes i have, and my monthly bill went up....so I took it upon myself to do something about, a streaming box, HD antenna, hulu, netflix and few other things and I\\'ve already cut my bill by 25%\\n@VerizonSupport Done.\\n@VerizonSupport Alright, done. Will reply back later if it beeps again.\\n@VerizonSupport Am I expected to do this every 24 hours? That\\'s how long the Alarm Silence lasted. Bedden back to beeping every 15 minutes since this morning.\\n@VerizonSupport I have no service with you at all. Can\\'t I just unplug it and remove the battery forever?\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you!\\n@VerizonSupport I have been waiting to be connected with a rep in this chat for more than 25 minutes now. This is honestly ridiculous, @115725 has honestly the WORST customer service I have ever experienced.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I made a payment and set up a payment to be taken out two days later. The payments were taken but then put back. A few days later it was taken out again and I was hit with an overdraft fee because of it. This isn’t the first time it’s happened.\\n@VerizonSupport The remote doesn\\'t work\\n@VerizonSupport Also while I have you, why do I have to pay for certain seasons of sex and the city but I pay for a HBO subscription??\\n@VerizonSupport Well one of your customer service representatives knows a way around it. They gave me that information yesterday. #TerribleCustomerService\\n@VerizonSupport NOT WHAT I WAS TOLD YESTERDAY! You don’t even care!!!!!!\\n@VerizonSupport Yesterday I was told it would not. I want Verizon to honor the information I was given yesterday when I called to look at all my options, so that I could make an informed decision. You are punishing a customer. Without a doubt, you treat new customers better that current ones\\n@VerizonSupport We have 12 months left, which is why I specifically asked if an early termination fee would apply. I was told no.\\n@VerizonSupport I would like to drop my cable and phone and start a new 2 year contract with internet only. Yesterday I was told no early termination fee would be charged because of the new 2 year contract. Today, they want to charge me $130 early termination fee.\\n@VerizonSupport yes Oct 6 but didnt notice until thanksgiving evening , when my husband noticed our bill had fallen off of auto pay on credit card\\n@VerizonSupport I bought I phone x at Apple store fully paid then is my I phone x is locked to your carrier\\n@VerizonSupport Yes she said over the phone. I don’t recall the conversation and searched my inbox for a confirmation email .\\n@VerizonSupport Yes. As I said, Verizon is screwing me over. You are going back on the information I was provided yesterday. I took time to get the information and make an informed decision. Today you changed that information. Wasted my time. It’s disrespectful on your part.\\n@VerizonSupport And I am sure she would have apologized instead of making me feel like an idiot and belittling me. Look at everything you have said to me.... where do you admit that Verizon made a mistake? All you say is “the fee applies” or “we can’t do that”\\n@VerizonSupport We need your support for net neutrality. \\n#NetNeutrality\\n@VerizonSupport Honestly nothing that you can fix unfortunately. Fios isn\\'t offered where I live, that and I\\'m a bit of a smartass 😁\\n@VerizonSupport I was referred to a tier 2 support number for a replacement phone that was sent to the wrong address. The original problem with the phone is that I can\\'t make calls. I want to get reimbursed for having to do my own overnight shipping.\\n@VerizonSupport @803702 I’m struggling over here with @115900 😤 https://t.co/FkLAEGHYtf\\n@VerizonSupport Your cell only.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport My bill is incredibly higher than it should be, and I was misinformed/uninformed about several fees. Customer service told me to go to the retail location, the retail associate told me to call billing.. where do I go from here?\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular.\\n@VerizonSupport You don’t care. I am just an account number to you. Read this conversation. Not once do you apologize or recongnize wrong doing. I am a human. I know the information I received yesterday and I want you to honor it.\\n@VerizonSupport Order number: NY00349261767\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, they are all connected.\\n@VerizonSupport The widget.\\n@VerizonSupport All fixed. Thank you! 😃\\n@VerizonSupport Changed $90 last summer that was supposed to be credited back in July - never happened (of course)\\n@VerizonSupport Some installation charge for an upgraded service. Was told it would be credited back on the next bill\\n@VerizonSupport Residential\\n@VerizonSupport the new episodes of teen mom 2 aren’t available even though they aired more than a week ago\\n@VerizonSupport Already there, but I was charged by @119000 for 25 days of service I didn\\'t receive and they were \"not able\" (more like not willing!) to help\\n@VerizonSupport My issue needs the attention of an actual human being, it is not something I can modify online.\\n@VerizonSupport Not receiving promotional promised amount for trade in. Spent 2 hours on phone and  After being tossed around throughout customer service I finally got Tanner from the tradein dept. We got everything squared away. While he was processing paperwork we somehow got disconcted\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport First of all, I need the sales gentleman that researched and delivered an offer with my #specific requirements. I cannot find his e. If you make it shiny, I will sign on right now. You can install tomorrow.\\n@VerizonSupport the test failed on the upload\\n@VerizonSupport my pc\\n@VerizonSupport ive tested across multiple computers and other devices - i get the same result - mostly worse then this (40s up and down)\\n@VerizonSupport My phone was acting up earlier but I.T seems to be functioning properly now. My internet however is down, there is an orange light in place of a green light for internet.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, I reset my internet router and then proceeded to do the same for my ONT\\n@VerizonSupport Still not working\\n@VerizonSupport Wireless\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Oh sorry, I’m actually talking about Fios. There are two conncections that transmit from the router. A normal and 5g connection.\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah, the devices are recognizing it but when the password is entered its not being recognized on any device\\n@VerizonSupport The phones are mostly Apple, but im also having trouble connecting to the 5g on Xbox one.\\n@VerizonSupport I haven’t tried it yet\\n@VerizonSupport Well I am off the phone now, and with no help to be found- can you call me now?\\n@VerizonSupport I am having billing issues with fios tv and internet\\n@VerizonSupport Tell me - can you get a manager from the billing department and services to just call me back directly?  So I don\\'t have to cry again on the phone?\\n@VerizonSupport There is a crew here now! Thank you! They say it could be a couple hours. I\\'m glad it\\'s getting fixed, though. Hope there won\\'t be a whole block of #pittsburghers missing @862 tonight!\\n@VerizonSupport Imagine how many customers you’d lose if no one could call @115725 for two solid weeks. Let alone what’d happen without WiFi in your office for that long.\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks for your help. But if this isn’t fixed soon, my business may not be around for it to matter anymore.\\n@VerizonSupport Let alone trying to do everything on my phone and iPad because there’s no WiFi.\\n@VerizonSupport Sharp TV, yes 2 button top!\\n@VerizonSupport Volume works ok, yes the bottom left A/V button!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes!\\n@VerizonSupport That worked - thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes, repair person says its not your\\'s.\\n@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport it\\'s a novel how about you call me and we talk. Unless you want me to actually explain everything to the world.\\n@VerizonSupport @806703 @VerizonSupport yeah still need help.

Nothing in that or the phone.\\n@VerizonSupport Nope\\n@VerizonSupport The Ethernet is already plugged into the ONT. It\\'s the newer ont installed this year. I just need the port turned on. https://t.co/qR8L2cFJv5\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s a new connection to an existing system but I was told that self setup is not a thing unless I op for 50/50 or 100/100.  I have my own router and am very capable of troubleshooting. Ive been stuck without internet. It\\'s the new black ont.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport Residential service\\n@VerizonSupport I am talking to a rep who is of no help either also 3 hours 32 min is the cap for that hold if you care.\\n@VerizonSupport I AM IN THE CHAT YOU GAVE ME IT TOOK 30 MIN FOR SOMEONE TO GET TO ME AND HAS BEEN LITTLE HELP SO FAR.\\n@VerizonSupport We\\'ve been told multiple times, it would cost too much money to run fiber optics to where we are.\\n@VerizonSupport Constantly goes off an on. And when it is on its only on for about 3-4 min then off again. It\\'s been happening to a lot of my neighbors as well. We\\'ve all been customers for years and are very disappointed with our service.\\n@VerizonSupport No, it just goes out, then after a few minutes or more it turns back on. Then repeats that\\n@VerizonSupport Both. Seems like the modem is constantly connecting and reconnecting\\n@VerizonSupport 1 computer 3 phones and 1 Xbox 1 Nintendo switch\\n@VerizonSupport We\\'ve disconnected all of them and it still does it.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok. But it still doesn\\'t make sense that our entire neiborhood is having the same issue....\\n@VerizonSupport @808224 Hey bot. Is NYC down?\\n@VerizonSupport Done. Still same. BTW tried both - on LTE and on home WiFi (FIOS). https://t.co/sksXtY0wpE\\n@VerizonSupport Yes - any and every one of them.\\n@VerizonSupport Done. Same result https://t.co/j49upLlsZl\\n@VerizonSupport Long story but after going thru all details on how great product is &amp; don’t need anything extra, needed a network extender costing me $100!\\n@VerizonSupport Decided to switch they confirmed we had Fios before in the Home and nothing else would be needed for this superior product\\n@VerizonSupport I didn’t have an issue until we switched to Fios. They couldn’t get a signal without it. I️ shouldn’t have to pay for the equipment you need\\n@VerizonSupport Nope. It was in my office ( I️ work from home). Fios tech could only put router in basement and get a direct plug in to my office by\\n@VerizonSupport We tried and called several times. We are just going to cancel. You could save a new customer but refunding $100 but you’re not willing\\n@VerizonSupport Well when we called to cancel, the rep ended up waiting the cost instead. It’s still disappointing to have started off like this\\n@VerizonSupport This doesn\\'t help my situation.  I\\'m on a cell phone trying to enter my zip and it can\\'t find it.\\n@VerizonSupport I can\\'t sign into my account since because my wife has the info and she is on a plane right now.  All I know is that internet and TV went down at 915p EST\\n@VerizonSupport On the front, the top light is red, the one below that is white\\n@VerizonSupport It looks like the backup battery was dead.  I replaced it and still the same thing. Top light red bottom is white\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport That\\'s the thing, it only shows faqs about what to do about power outages.  And when I enter my zip code, it can\\'t find my area\\n@VerizonSupport @810372 If you\\'d really like to assist, please help make our voice heard. Don\\'t support this atrocious plan to abolish Net Neutrality...\\n@VerizonSupport @810372 Bruh. How the fuck did y\\'all get here so fast????\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Oh sorry, I keep Tweeting the wrong account 🙄\\n@VerizonSupport @810928 Your upload AND download speed better be as fast as this reply or you won\\'t have me on board\\n@VerizonSupport It’s my cell phone. The service just keeps dropping randomly tonight.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Thank you,  I apologize for having to take this route but clearly no one else was going to d9 anything. So thank you for your time.\\n@VerizonSupport Cellular\\n@VerizonSupport Orders were given to the proper channels to have my account put on hold while on deployment. I was told it was taken care of no worries right? Than a month later while overseas I receive a bill for almost 1000$ So again I contact and email my orders from deployment as per request\\n@VerizonSupport Did you read what I posted? I need a # to speak to someone abt Internet billing directly. Not leave my # for a call back. Not the wireless #.\\n@VerizonSupport Tried that already. I got an offshore person who wasn\\'t able to help me. Now we are going in circles.\\n@VerizonSupport 11/20\\n@VerizonSupport any way to get it sooner? I need it to submit to T-mobile for the rebates. That seems like a very long time to wait\\n@VerizonSupport No. He spent hours onsite Nov. 24. Said it would be all set by that afternoon.\\n@VerizonSupport Very nice technician James has been trying to resolve. Tells us he can’t understand why it’s taking so long.\\n@VerizonSupport My service was abruptly cut off and no is able to tell me exactly what happened or why. My service has been off since last Friday. I have a $0 balance and I pay bill early not just on time. I’ve been transferred from tech support, customer services, financial services &amp; nothing.\\n@VerizonSupport Apparently it wasn’t cut off. The 18th Verizon rep I spoke to was able to fix the issue. It’s unfortunate it took that many attempts to get the matter resolved.\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 Thanks, says \"No service\". zip 07410. One out of four phone\\'s\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it says activate . https://t.co/hFHRWbCd2t took too long to respond\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/nvwMIokPHe\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t but I think it may have just connected. This error though has never happened for me before\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/WJOJ4j33nW\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'m not sure where the modem is\\n@VerizonSupport Long story short, Verizon store would not accept my phone in store for trade and said to call customer service for packing and shipping label . I had to call multiple times and never recieved it. I did however still return the phone but they said it was past the deadline\\n@VerizonSupport very slow data speeds\\n@VerizonSupport Say what\\n@VerizonSupport cellular\\n@VerizonSupport Different outcome than @56095, but same results: not good. https://t.co/Gyxbw8vA26\\n@VerizonSupport Nope! On my mac. No VPNs, nothin\\'.\\n@VerizonSupport Using an airport extreme because it has a measurably longer reach in our apt vs. VZ router. No help here, though.\\n@VerizonSupport Can confirm 2 other devices connected but not in use. ...This is also me 20ft closer to the router. Better, but still 35-40% poorer than promised. https://t.co/9v7533D3xn\\n@VerizonSupport For my cell\\n@VerizonSupport Thank you and will do. Really going to try to put these new speeds thru their paces!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes will our phones and computers. Thank you so much!\\n@VerizonSupport I have tried and all they do is say they will escalate it and I got that letter weeks ago saying they are working on it and that was it nothing further. So why should I waste another 30 min on phone only to get brushed off again!\\n@VerizonSupport I got my rewards back but I never got my referral rewards and this is the second time this happen! No one ever answers emails either. This person used my referral code and everything and it has been 4 months now and I still didn\\'t get those rewards.\\n@VerizonSupport A tree hit our house a month ago. We\\'re waiting for all the pieces to fall back into place so we can move back in. Internet is nearly as important as power and I won\\'t move back in without it. Thanks for the response.\\n@VerizonSupport 250 down under 200 up tsk tsk my router is an AC4400 too\\n@VerizonSupport i tested it wirelessly wired and through the router\\n@VerizonSupport My dad’s cell is working but the new number for his landline isn’t working. So not sure if I wrote it down wrong or if it’s just not working.\\n@VerizonSupport 5 more months and I\\'ll be there!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport Ordered a jacket through the rewards program over a month ago. Paid for it but haven\\'t received and no one knows when I\\'ll get it.\\n@VerizonSupport Ok thank you\\n@VerizonSupport Provide your customer service with faster resources. Don’t always want MORE Service want lower $. Entire lunch was wasted. So annoyed\\n@VerizonSupport SOLENT HOLD AS SOON AS I AM CONNECTED AND NOT TO BE CUT OFF MID WORD\\n@VerizonSupport @115725 spoke to the Amazing Nicole White from your customer service and got it all taken care of for the most part. She was so helpful and actually listen to my issue with Verizon. Thank you\\n@VerizonSupport Transferring service to home I am purchasing. Spoke to 5 people over 3 hours and all can\\'t think outside box. May need to cancel fios\\n@VerizonSupport Internet &amp; phone just came back on. Not sure what happened, but glad it’s back.\\n@VerizonSupport We’ve had our equipment replaced more often than we’d like. We always get the same response when we called to complain—reboot your system that should fix everything. Well that never works. It always ends up with someone replacing something.\\n@VerizonSupport I figured it out, thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport Well, I ordered a new phone 10 days ago and still haven\\'t gotten it. And after calling customer service four times over the past week, I\\'m told that this morning my order was canceled. So now I\\'m on hold again while another customer service rep tries to take care of this...\\n@VerizonSupport I’ve been on hold forever and cannot reach anyone in the business department. And my residential renewal rates did not meet my satisfaction\\n@VerizonSupport Well that was quick. I want to cancel my home phone, and cancel one bedroom box. And then go over my bill because it\\'s ridiculous. But I\\'m not going to wait \"more than an hour for the next customer service representative.\" Not at the prices I\\'m paying. So you tell me what to do.\\n@VerizonSupport Just so we are all on the same page? I followed and DM\\'d. When they told me to. I\\'m not holding my breath.\\n@VerizonSupport Just by the online tools, which say $95/month, up from $75 from our current service.\\n@VerizonSupport The issue was ultimately solved. What was initially a frustrating experience ended with me being completely satisfied. A+ to the representative who helped me.\\n@VerizonSupport I was finally able to reach a representative who was very kind. Technical issues are forcing her to give me a call back. I\\'d like to keep lines of communication open here.\\n@VerizonSupport New York\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ve reached out to Verizon on June 27th, July 24th and Sept 5th and opted out from \"do not mail\" list every phone call. I was told it would take 90 days which it is well beyond 90 days from my first two phone calls.\\n@VerizonSupport Astoria, Queens\\n@VerizonSupport Something about there being an issue on Verizon\\'s end and could send the signal.\\n@VerizonSupport Red\\n@VerizonSupport No.\\n@VerizonSupport -- cellular.

It’s been crappy for the past month and it gets worst by the day\\n@VerizonSupport Okay trying that now!\\n@VerizonSupport Emailed it\\n@VerizonSupport I’m gonna dm you. But gotta be honest I almost want this to be public. Because your customer services thus far have been horrible. Is kinda like everyone to see how you treat your customers and handle this situation\\n@VerizonSupport I am a new customer, but apparently the person before has never had their account disconnected.

Time is money tick tock @VerizonSupport\\n@VerizonSupport Like I said can I get my last hour back. If you can\\'t give me that you can\\'t help.\\n@VerizonSupport No all I need is a replacement modem.  The 5ghz band is flakey at best.  Have to reboot modem weekly due to this and other speed issues\\n@VerizonSupport Yeah return the last hour of my life.  Train your reps to be empathetic.  And get a better automated system @VerizonSupport\\n@VerizonSupport I did no one is responding\\n@VerizonSupport Great in our DM. You just gave me the same number I have called since Sunday. An automated system with a 15 minute wait!  Huge help\\n@VerizonSupport Thanks. My problem actually was repaired through the troubleshooter on the website.\\n@VerizonSupport When I check the outage map is this a bad sign https://t.co/IQ8cbH6v8M\\n@VerizonSupport Verizon computers shut us down by mistake Sunday afternoon. Internet phone and tv.  Getting service back up has been a NOGHTMARE. As of today I have internet and still no tv.   Working with someone again this am who is telling me he hasn’t give my back my dvd services.\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry. Didn\\'t see this. The show itself. Thanks\\n@VerizonSupport wireless\\n@VerizonSupport I’m not sure actually. I have an agent with me now, but we may have to start the hour over.\\n@VerizonSupport All TVs, and shows on TLC - 90 day fiancé is one\\n@VerizonSupport Honestly I\\'d rather just have a call than all this talk on twitter. But they show up as a choice. The sound doesn\\'t work correctly. I reported it twice. I just want it fixed, if you can\\'t fix it I would like money taken off my next bill. The service agent on the phone was awful.\\n@VerizonSupport Nothing, she said she couldn\\'t do anything. I asked to speak to a manager and she refused, then said someone would call me back within an hour. They called me back today when I was at work and couldn\\'t speak.\\n@VerizonSupport I did it all, myself and with your tech support.\\n@VerizonSupport I think I\\'m in. I should be signing in tonight.\\n@VerizonSupport I have time now and am at the cart. I do not have that model number and do not need the rental of the router, is it fine if I press continue?\\n@VerizonSupport I chatted with rep. I am in!!! Have to wait a week :( Will check to see if anything opens earlier.\\n@VerizonSupport Chatting with a rep now. Thanks.\\n@VerizonSupport They want me to do a secure chat on Facebook but I need a link.\\n@VerizonSupport And supposedly you’ve made your bills easier to read. I notice no change and when I click the link to see the changes, it’s a dead link\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport no i am considering adding it to my FIOS triple play\\n@VerizonSupport No. It’s the onhub connected to the fios fueled Ethernet cable.\\n@VerizonSupport Still terrible. I dare you to fix this\\n@VerizonSupport It righted itself after multiple attempts. This is a chronic problem, sometimes lasts all day.\\n@VerizonSupport 100% of the time we try to watch something on demand the video and audio breaks up. I’ve called about it at least 4 times. I’ve unplugged everything 726 times and followed your instructions. Problem not solved. Plus, your on demand selection is embarrassing.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport I don’t know. We only watch on demand on one. We’ve run into trouble with the same (roughly) dozen channels every time this happens. And I’m sent through the same trouble shooting process. Question is, why am I always having trouble\\n@VerizonSupport What’re those people called that go to customers houses to do these things? Techs? Are they not a thing anymore. Are customers now the techs?\\n@VerizonSupport currently but will reach out on DM at soonest opportunity.  Spoke with rep earlier and she was looking for update from engineer escalation team.  thanks!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes I can do that\\n@VerizonSupport I am referring to my WiFi at home\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport @115990 No need I will be transferring to a different provider when I’m off work. This is unacceptable\\n@VerizonSupport They never completed our auto pay or paperless when we transferred off family plan. We gave this over phone to Verizon rep. I was also awarded a $45 credit for the next three months due to data issues. And one line was supposed to be disconnected end of October that wasn’t.\\n@VerizonSupport Incompetent people. I am going to switch providers after work. Absolutely absurd and rude. I’m in actually dumbfounded at how they’re speaking to me right now. Unbelievable\\n@VerizonSupport Yes two boxes, it appears to be just this box/TV combo.\\n@VerizonSupport One TV and the main box. Happens to different channels.\\n@VerizonSupport yes!\\n@VerizonSupport Nope!\\n@VerizonSupport It\\'s a new TV, so I\\'ve noticed it maybe 10-25% of the time it happens.\\n@VerizonSupport I got a human on the phone\\n@VerizonSupport Mobile service. Check my acct you will see the notes and the guarantee that I would be repaid for previous mistake by YOUR COMPANY! And now they blatantly disrespect me like this. I am disgusted\\n@VerizonSupport I had an agreement with you to fix a major issue and after a thousand attempts it was resolved. You forced me to pay the next 2 months only to be completely taken advantage of again! I have never felt so disrespected!!!!\\n@VerizonSupport slide in my dms https://t.co/fkCsk2lI7Y\\n@VerizonSupport The first date available :D just seeing if there\\'s a secret way to get an even earlier date\\n@VerizonSupport I have reset. Only the HD box is having the issue. Of course :-)\\n@VerizonSupport Power light on, nothing else\\n@VerizonSupport Neither. I\\'m having trouble with the statement released today saying you support Net Neutrality and repealing Title II protections. How do you expect Net Neutrality protections to be enforced without Title II protections, given  the 2015 federal appeals court ruling?\\n@VerizonSupport wireless.\\n@VerizonSupport i have tried that as well. my connection is still poor.\\n@VerizonSupport i have also tried the wifi analyzer as well...\\n@VerizonSupport 50MBPS.\\n@VerizonSupport YO, you cant look at my account info and see wtf is going on with my account. DAMN!\\n@VerizonSupport soooooo you’re telling me that your service aren’t what you guys display on television? that i’m not guaranteed reliable wifi services? you’re saying it’s a hit or miss with your wireless internet? you’re telling me i should switch services?\\n@VerizonSupport thanks for the chat and not being able to help me with my service. #beblessed\\n@VerizonSupport in the master bedroom. and i’m trying to access it in the master bedroom. like right now the service is being interfered. i think i’m going to have to switch providers!\\n@VerizonSupport 48.50\\n@VerizonSupport i’ve done that as well MULTIPLE times.\\n@VerizonSupport my internet speed &amp; connection. i’ve rest and restored the modem and it’s still working poorly. 🤬\\n@VerizonSupport Now announcing outage in my area. My I.pagination or are these becoming more frequent??\\n@VerizonSupport 5:48 but it seems to be fixed...for the moment.\\n@VerizonSupport Yes\\n@VerizonSupport half our channels are working so that won’t help the issue\\n@VerizonSupport it is bravo and all hd channels\\n@VerizonSupport it’s live tv and yes it is happening on all of them\\n@VerizonSupport @142065 I\\'m a customer.  You will not bring fiber here anytime soon.  And I\\'m outside of Boston, very tech heavy.\\n@VerizonSupport @143012 Expanding? Buffalo, NY is still waiting on FIOS, even after Verizon was gifted dark fiber to bring it to Buffalo...\\n@VerizonSupport No, you\\'re not.  Verizon said Buffalo will never get FIOS, because it has to be installed city wide in a reasonable amount of time.\\n\\nEven after Verizon was gifted dark fiber, with the promise they would build out.\\n@VerizonSupport Sorry. Still getting \"no signal.\"\\n@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/OeB2716zbk\\n@VerizonSupport already do\\n@VerizonSupport No. Theres a million wires and plugs back there.\\n@VerizonSupport I just did it.

Why would you send me a gift card if I can’t use it?\\n@VerizonSupport Repair techs on phone tell me there\\'s an order for my line deletion today. Forward me to customer service billing to resolve that issue. But that department is closed today. My 20yr old business line is going to be deleted today by Verizon\\'s incompetence. HELP. @115725\\n@VerizonSupport We can do that over email or call me directly instead of making me wait again\\n@VerizonSupport Look at the issue and email the email on file for the a/c. I\\'ve already verified in the chat with screenshots DMd to you yesterday and you\\'ve already looked at my account this morning.

I can get that in email.\\n@VerizonSupport Last week\\n@VerizonSupport Jamaica Plain, ma 02130 off center street\\n@VerizonSupport Nevermind. Your boy in upstate New York finally answered.

No progress, no help.\\n@VerizonSupport No, I\\'m speaking with an agent but no agent that I\\'ve spoken with has been able to fix the problem.  Everyone is very great at saying that they\\'re \"sorry\", but it\\'s all meaningless.\\n@VerizonSupport No, they are instead making excuses as to why Verizon is allowed to no-show to tech visits and why promised manager call-backs don\\'t happen like they are supposed to.\\n@VerizonSupport I\\'ll let her know and pass the baton.  Hopefully someone can explain why her bill increased without her knowledge or consent.\\n@VerizonSupport I hope so!\\n@VerizonSupport Yes it is, sometimes it will stay white but with no connection, tried to reset to factory default with no custom settings, the tests the tech did were inconclusive, said we will be receiving a call to upgrade the ONT\\n@VerizonSupport Just this app.\\n@VerizonSupport Today I go on to watch hbo on demand and the picture isn’t coming in and I get an error message\\n@VerizonSupport I don\\'t know what the difference is. Its not plugged into the wall like when I had AT&amp;T but I don\\'t think it goes thru my internet.\\n@VerizonSupport There shouldn\\'t be a list, especially in or around Baltimore.

I\\'m not home right now, but will try this later this evening.  I have the Arris VMS1100 DVR model.\\n@VerizonSupport that’s not the question I asked.\\n@VerizonSupport If Access to https://t.co/FGziyL2j5C was included with a Center Ice subscription. This is included on the DirecTV Center Ice subscription.\\n@VerizonSupport I had to upgrade last night to get them - from basic to Premium - an add\\'l $40 per month.  Spike, ESPN, CNBC, etc.\\n@VerizonSupport May / June. I complained about this within a week and was told I needed to upgrade - so I didnt.
